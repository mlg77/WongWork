abstract = {Fifty years ago, FitzHugh introduced a phase portrait that became famous for a twofold reason: it captured in a physiological way the qualitative behavior of Hodgkin-Huxley model and it revealed the power of simple dynamical models to unfold complex firing patterns. To date, in spite of the enormous progresses in qualitative and quantitative neural modeling, this phase portrait has remained a core picture of neuronal excitability. Yet, a major difference between the neurophysiology of 1961 and of 2011 is the recognition of the prominent role of calcium channels in firing mechanisms. We show that including this extra current in Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics leads to a revision of FitzHugh-Nagumo phase portrait that affects in a fundamental way the reduced modeling of neural excitability. The revisited model considerably enlarges the modeling power of the original one. In particular, it captures essential electrophysiological signatures that otherwise require non-physiological alteration or considerable complexification of the classical model. As a basic illustration, the new model is shown to highlight a core dynamical mechanism by which calcium channels control the two distinct firing modes of thalamocortical neurons.},

abstract = {Functional hyperemia is an important metabolic autoregulation mechanism by which increased neuronal activity is matched by a rapid and regional increase in blood supply. This mechanism is facilitated by a process known as "neurovascular coupling"-the orchestrated communication system involving neurons, astrocytes and arterioles. Important steps in this process are the production of EETs in the astrocyte and the release of potassium, via two potassium channels (BK and KIR), into the perivascular space. We provide a model which successfully accounts for several observations seen in experiment. The model is capable of simulating the approximate 15\% arteriolar dilation caused by a 60-s neuronal activation (modelled as a release of potassium and glutamate into the synaptic cleft). This model also successfully emulates the paradoxical experimental finding that vasoconstriction follows vasodilation when the astrocytic calcium concentration (or perivascular potassium concentration) is increased further. We suggest that the interaction of the changing smooth muscle cell membrane potential and the changing potassium-dependent resting potential of the KIR channel are responsible for this effect. Finally, we demonstrate that a well-controlled mechanism of potassium buffering is potentially important for successful neurovascular coupling. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Neurons are extremely vulnerable cells that tightly rely on the brain's highly dynamic and complex vascular network that assures an accurate and adequate distribution of nutrients and oxygen. The neurovascular unit (NVU) couples neuronal activity to vascular function, controls brain homeostasis, and maintains an optimal brain microenvironment adequate for neuronal survival by adjusting blood-brain barrier (BBB) parameters based on brain needs. The NVU is a heterogeneous structure constituted by different cell types that includes pericytes. Pericytes are localized at the abluminal side of brain microvessels and contribute to NVU function. Pericytes play essential roles in the development and maturation of the neurovascular system during embryogenesis and stability during adulthood. Initially, pericytes were described as contractile cells involved in controlling neurovascular tone. However, recent reports have shown that pericytes dynamically respond to stress induced by injury upon brain diseases, by chemically and physically communicating with neighboring cells, by their immune properties and by their potential pluripotent nature within the neurovascular niche. As such, in this paper, we would like to review the role of pericytes in NVU remodeling, and their potential as targets for NVU repair strategies and consequently neuroprotection in two pathophysiologically distinct brain disorders: ischemic stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD).},

abstract = {The brain is critically dependent on a continuous supply of blood to function. Therefore, the cerebral vasculature is endowed with neurovascular control mechanisms that assure that the blood supply of the brain is commensurate to the energy needs of its cellular constituents. The regulation of cerebral blood flow (CBF) during brain activity involves the coordinated interaction of neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Thus, whereas neurons and glia generate the signals initiating the vasodilation, endothelial cells, pericytes, and smooth muscle cells act in concert to transduce these signals into carefully orchestrated vascular changes that lead to CBF increases focused to the activated area and temporally linked to the period of activation. Neurovascular coupling is disrupted in pathological conditions, such as hypertension, Alzheimer disease, and ischemic stroke. Consequently, CBF is no longer matched to the metabolic requirements of the tissue. This cerebrovascular dysregulation is mediated in large part by the deleterious action of reactive oxygen species on cerebral blood vessels. A major source of cerebral vascular radicals in models of hypertension and Alzheimer disease is the enzyme NADPH oxidase. These findings, collectively, highlight the importance of neurovascular coupling to the health of the normal brain and suggest a therapeutic target for improving brain function in pathologies associated with cerebrovascular dysfunction.},

abstract = {The human brain has often been viewed as outstanding among mammalian brains: the most cognitively able, the largest-than-expected from body size, endowed with an overdeveloped cerebral cortex that represents over 80\% of brain mass, and purportedly containing 100 billion neurons and 10x more glial cells. Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19\% of all brain neurons, a fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call for a re-examination of several concepts related to the exceptionality of the human brain.},

Here, we focus on three types of models which generate complex networks, i.e. the Erd$\backslash$H\{o\}s-R$\backslash$'enyi, the Watts-Strogatz and the threshold network models. From analysis of the Laplacian matrices of graphs generated by these models, we reveal that the stable-unstable regions of a spatially homogeneous solution completely differ, depending on network structures. In particular, we approximately argue the existence of the stable-unstable regions in the cases of regular enhanced ring lattices which include regular circles, and networks generated by the threshold network model when the number of vertices is large enough.},

abstract = {As a result of natural selection driven by severe forms of malaria, 1 in 6 humans in the world, more than 1 billion people, are affected by red cell abnormalities, making them the most common of the inherited disorders. The non-nucleated red cell is unique among human cell type in that the plasma membrane, its only structural component, accounts for all of its diverse antigenic, transport, and mechanical characteristics. Our current concept of the red cell membrane envisions it as a composite structure in which a membrane envelope composed of cholesterol and phospholipids is secured to an elastic network of skeletal proteins via transmembrane proteins. Structural and functional characterization of the many constituents of the red cell membrane, in conjunction with biophysical and physiologic studies, has led to detailed description of the way in which the remarkable mechanical properties and other important characteristics of the red cells arise, and of the manner in which they fail in disease states. Current studies in this very active and exciting field are continuing to produce new and unexpected revelations on the function of the red cell membrane and thus of the cell in health and disease, and shed new light on membrane function in other diverse cell types.},

abstract = {Confocal laser scanning microscopy and Fluo-4 were used to visualize Ca(2+) transients within individual smooth muscle cells (SMC) of rat resistance arteries during alpha(1)-adrenoceptor activation. The typical spatio-temporal pattern of [Ca(2+)] in an artery after exposure to a maximally effective concentration of phenylephrine (PE, 10.0 microM) was a large, brief, relatively homogeneous Ca(2+) transient, followed by Ca(2+) waves, which then declined in frequency over the course of 5 min and which were asynchronous in different SMC. Concentration-Effect (CE) curves relating the concentration of PE (range: 0.1 microM to 10.0 microM) to the effects (fraction of cells producing at least one Ca(2+) wave, and number of Ca(2+) waves during 5 min) had EC(50) values of approximately 0.5 microM and approximately 1.0 microM respectively. The initial Ca(2+) transient and the subsequent Ca(2+) waves were abolished in the presence of caffeine (10.0 mM). A repeated exposure to PE, 1.5 min after the first had ended, elicited fewer Ca(2+) waves in fewer cells than did the initial exposure. Caffeine-sensitive Ca(2+) stores were not depleted at this time, however, as caffeine alone was capable of inducing a large release of Ca(2+)1.5 min after PE. In summary, the mechanism of a graded response to graded alpha(1)-adrenoceptor activation is the progressive 'recruitment' of individual SMC, which then respond in 'all or none' fashion (viz. asynchronous Ca(2+) waves). Ca(2+) signaling continues in the arterial wall throughout the time-course (at least 5 min) of activation of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. The fact that the Ca(2+) waves are asynchronous accounts for the previously reported fall in 'arterial wall [Ca(2+)]' (i.e. spatial average [Ca(2+)] over all cells).},

The ability of a wide diversity of cells to display intercellular Ca2+ waves suggests that these Ca2+ waves may represent a general mechanism by which cells communicate. Although Ca2+ may permeate gap junctions, the intercellular movement of Ca2+ is not essential for the propagation of Ca2+ waves. The messenger that moves from one cell to the next through gap junctions appears to be IP3 and a regenerative mechanism for IP3 may be required to effect multicellular communication. Extracellularly mediated Ca2+ signaling also exists and this could be employed to supplement or replace gap junctional communication. The function of intercellular Ca2+ waves may be the coordination of cooperative cellular responses to local stimuli.},

Cortical folding takes place during embryonic development and is important to optimize the functional organization and wiring of the brain, as well as to allow fitting a large cortex in a limited cranial volume. Pathological alterations in size or folding of the human cortex lead to severe intellectual disability and intractable epilepsy. Hence, cortical expansion and folding are viewed as key processes in mammalian brain development and evolution, ultimately leading to increased intellectual performance and, eventually, to the emergence of human cognition. Here, we provide an overview and discuss some of the most significant advances in our understanding of cortical expansion and folding over the last decades. These include discoveries in multiple and diverse disciplines, from cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating cortical development and neurogenesis, genetic mechanisms defining the patterns of cortical folds, the biomechanics of cortical growth and buckling, lessons from human disease, and how genetic evolution steered cortical size and folding during mammalian evolution.},

abstract = {A principal means of transmitting intracellular calcium (Ca2+) waves at junctions between astrocytes involves the release of the chemical transmitter adenosine triphosphate (ATP). A model of this process is presented in which activation of purinergic P2Y receptors by ATP triggers the release of ATP, in an autocrine manner, as well as concomitantly increasing intracellular Ca2+. The dependence of the temporal characteristics of the Ca2+ wave are shown to critically depend on the dissociation constant (K(R)) for ATP binding to the P2Y receptor type. Incorporating this model astrocyte into networks of these cells successfully accounts for many of the properties of propagating Ca2+ waves, such as the dependence of velocity on the type of P2Y receptor and the time-lag of the Ca2+ wave behind the ATP wave. In addition, the conditions under which Ca2+ waves may jump from one set of astrocytes across an astrocyte-free lane to another set of astrocytes are quantitatively accounted for by the model. The properties of purinergic transmission at astrocyte junctions may determine many of the characteristics of Ca2+ propagation in networks of these cells.},

abstract = {Astrocytes are critical regulators of neural and neurovascular network communication. Potassium transport is a central mechanism behind their many functions. Astrocytes encircle synapses with their distal processes, which express two potassium pumps (Na-K and NKCC) and an inward rectifying potassium channel (Kir), whereas the vessel-adjacent endfeet express Kir and BK potassium channels. We provide a detailed model of potassium flow throughout the neurovascular unit (synaptic region, astrocytes, and arteriole) for the cortex of the young brain. Our model reproduces several phenomena observed experimentally: functional hyperemia, in which neural activity triggers astrocytic potassium release at the perivascular endfoot, inducing arteriole dilation; K+ undershoot in the synaptic space after periods of neural activity; neurally induced astrocyte hyperpolarization during Kir blockade. Our results suggest that the dynamics of the vascular response during functional hyperemia are governed by astrocytic Kir for the fast onset and astrocytic BK for maintaining dilation. The model supports the hypothesis that K+ undershoot is caused by excessive astrocytic uptake through Na-K and NKCC pumps, whereas the effect is balanced by Kir. We address parametric uncertainty using high-dimensional stochastic sensitivity analysis and identify possible model limitations. ?? 2013 Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Brain, heart and skeletal muscle share similar properties of excitable tissue, featuring both discrete behavior (all-or-nothing response to electrical activation) and continuous behavior (recovery to rest follows a temporal path, determined by multiple competing ion flows). Classical mathematical models of excitable cells involve complex systems of nonlinear differential equations. Such models not only impair formal analysis but also impose high computational demands on simulations, especially in large-scale 2-D and 3-D cell networks. In this paper, we show that by choosing Hybrid Automata as the modeling formalism, it is possible to construct a more abstract model of excitable cells that preserves the properties of interest while reducing the computational effort, thereby admitting the possibility of formal analysis and efficient simulation. RESULTS: We have developed CellExcite, a sophisticated simulation environment for excitable-cell networks. CellExcite allows the user to sketch a tissue of excitable cells, plan the stimuli to be applied during simulation, and customize the diffusion model. CellExcite adopts Hybrid Automata (HA) as the computational model in order to efficiently capture both discrete and continuous excitable-cell behavior. CONCLUSIONS: The CellExcite simulation framework for multicellular HA arrays exhibits significantly improved computational efficiency in large-scale simulations, thus opening the possibility for formal analysis based on HA theory. A demo of CellExcite is available at http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/\~{}eha/.},

abstract = {There is increasing evidence for bidirectional communication between glial cells and neurons. In this study, calcium signaling in primary glia/neuron cultures was investigated using video fluorescence imaging and fura-2. Glial cells in culture without neurons showed occasional spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ oscillations but not intercellular Ca2+ waves. By contrast, glial cells in culture with neurons showed frequent spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations as well as propagated intercellular Ca2+ waves. These spontaneous glial intercellular Ca2+ waves often emanated from sites of contact with neurons, but were only occasionally associated with increases in neuronal Ca2+. Mechanical stimulation of a single glial cell induced a glial intercellular Ca2+ wave which was similar in its temporal and spatial characteristics to spontaneous glial Ca2+ waves. Mechanically induced glial Ca2+ waves, but not spontaneous Ca2+ waves, evoked a transient increase in [Ca2+]i or a change in the pattern of spontaneous Ca2+ oscillations in a small percentage (< 10\%) of neighboring neurons. Mechanical stimulation of a single neuron consistently evoked an intercellular Ca2+ wave in neighboring glial cells. These results suggest distinct mechanisms for direct glial-neuronal and neuronal-glial communication. These signaling pathways may play important roles in both function and pathology in the central nervous system.},

abstract = {We review recent theoretical work that analyzes experimental measurements of the shape, fluctuations and adhesion properties of biological cells. Particular emphasis is placed on the role of the cytoskeleton and cell elasticity and we contrast the shape and adhesion of elastic cells with fluid-filled vesicles. In red blood cells (RBC), the cytoskeleton consists of a two-dimensional network of spectrin proteins. Our analysis of the wavevector and frequency dependence of the fluctuation spectrum of RBC indicates that the spectrin network acts as a confining potential that reduces the fluctuations of the lipid bilayer membrane. However, since the cytoskeleton is only sparsely connected to the bilayer, one cannot regard the composite cytoskeleton–membrane as a polymerized object with a shear modulus. The sensitivity of RBC fluctuations and shapes to ATP concentration may reflect topological defects induced in the cytoskeleton network by ATP. The shapes of cells that adhere to a substrate are strongly determined by the cytoskeletal elasticity that can be varied experimentally by drugs that depolymerize the cytoskeleton. This leads to a tension-driven retraction of the cell body and a pearling instability of the resulting ray-like protrusions. Recent experiments have shown that adhering cells exert polarized forces on substrates. The interactions of such ''force dipoles'' in either bulk gels or on surfaces can be used to predict the nature of self-assembly of cell aggregates and may be important in the formation of artificial tissues. Finally, we note that cell adhesion strongly depends on the forces exerted on the adhesion sites by the tension of the cytoskeleton. The size and shape of the adhesion regions are strongly modified as the tension is varied and we present an elastic model that relates this tension to deformations that induce the recruitment of new molecules to the adhesion region.

abstract = {Neurovascular dysfunction, including blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and cerebral blood flow (CBF) dysregulation and reduction, are increasingly recognized to contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The spatial and temporal relationships between different pathophysiological events during preclinical stages of AD, including cerebrovascular dysfunction and pathology, amyloid and tau pathology, and brain structural and functional changes remain, however, still unclear. Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, i.e., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), offer new possibilities to understand how the human brain works in health and disease. This includes methods to detect subtle regional changes in the cerebrovascular system integrity. Here, we focus on the neurovascular imaging techniques to evaluate regional BBB permeability (dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI), regional CBF changes (arterial spin labeling- and functional-MRI), vascular pathology (structural MRI), and cerebral metabolism (PET) in the living human brain, and examine how they can inform about neurovascular dysfunction and vascular pathophysiology in dementia and AD. Altogether, these neuroimaging approaches will continue to elucidate the spatio-temporal progression of vascular and neurodegenerative processes in dementia and AD and how they relate to each other.},

abstract = {Diffusion in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain is constrained by the volume fraction and the tortuosity and a modified diffusion equation represents the transport behavior of many molecules in the brain. Deviations from the equation reveal loss of molecules across the blood-brain barrier, through cellular uptake, binding, or other mechanisms. Early diffusion measurements used radiolabeled sucrose and other tracers. Presently, the real-time iontophoresis (RTI) method is employed for small ions and the integrative optical imaging (IOI) method for fluorescent macromolecules, including dextrans or proteins. Theoretical models and simulations of the ECS have explored the influence of ECS geometry, effects of dead-space microdomains, extracellular matrix, and interaction of macromolecules with ECS channels. Extensive experimental studies with the RTI method employing the cation tetramethylammonium (TMA) in normal brain tissue show that the volume fraction of the ECS typically is approximately 20\% and the tortuosity is approximately 1.6 (i.e., free diffusion coefficient of TMA is reduced by 2.6), although there are regional variations. These parameters change during development and aging. Diffusion properties have been characterized in several interventions, including brain stimulation, osmotic challenge, and knockout of extracellular matrix components. Measurements have also been made during ischemia, in models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and in human gliomas. Overall, these studies improve our conception of ECS structure and the roles of glia and extracellular matrix in modulating the ECS microenvironment. Knowledge of ECS diffusion properties is valuable in contexts ranging from understanding extrasynaptic volume transmission to the development of paradigms for drug delivery to the brain.},

abstract = {Spreading depression (SD) is a slowly propagating wave of neuronal and glial depolarization lasting a few minutes, that can develop within the cerebral cortex or other brain areas after electrical, mechanical or chemical depolarizing stimulations. Cortical SD (CSD) is considered the neurophysiological correlate of migraine aura. It is characterized by massive increases in both extracellular K⁺ and glutamate, as well as rises in intracellular Na⁺ and Ca²⁺. These ionic shifts produce slow direct current (DC) potential shifts that can be recorded extracellularly. Moreover, CSD is associated with changes in cortical parenchymal blood flow. CSD has been shown to be a common therapeutic target for currently prescribed migraine prophylactic drugs. Yet, no effects have been observed for the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, consistent with their lack of efficacy on migraine. Some molecules of interest for migraine have been tested for their effect on CSD. Specifically, blocking CSD may play an enabling role for novel benzopyran derivative tonabersat in preventing migraine with aura. Additionally, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists have been recently reported to inhibit CSD, suggesting the contribution of CGRP receptor activation to the initiation and maintenance of CSD not only at the classic vascular sites, but also at a central neuronal level. Understanding what may be lying behind this contribution, would add further insights into the mechanisms of actions for "gepants", which may be pivotal for the effectiveness of these drugs as anti-migraine agents. CSD models are useful tools for testing current and novel prophylactic drugs, providing knowledge on mechanisms of action relevant for migraine.},

In this study, by using a two-component red blood cell (RBC) model and systematic parameter variation, we perform detailed computational simulations to probe the alteration of the biomechanical, rheological, and dynamic behavior of T2DM RBCs in response to morphological change and membrane stiffening. First, we examine the elastic response of T2DM RBCs subject to static tensile forcing and their viscoelastic relaxation response upon release of the stretching force. Second, we investigate the membrane fluctuations of T2DM RBCs and explore the effect of cell shape on the fluctuation amplitudes. Third, we subject the T2DM RBCs to shear flow and probe the effects of cell shape and effective membrane viscosity on their tank-treading movement. In addition, we model the cell dynamic behavior in a microfluidic channel with constriction and quantify the biorheological properties of individual T2DM RBCs. Finally, we simulate T2DM RBC suspensions under shear and compare the predicted viscosity with experimental measurements. Taken together, these simulation results and their comparison with currently available experimental data are helpful in identifying a specific parametric model—the first of its kind, to our knowledge—that best describes the main hallmarks of T2DM RBCs, which can be used in future simulation studies of hematologic complications of T2DM patients.},

abstract = {The response of a model microelectrochemical system to a time-dependent applied voltage is analyzed. The article begins with a fresh historical review including electrochemistry, colloidal science, and microfluidics. The model problem consists of a symmetric binary electrolyte between parallel-plate blocking electrodes, which suddenly apply a voltage. Compact Stern layers on the electrodes are also taken into account. The Nernst-Planck-Poisson equations are first linearized and solved by Laplace transforms for small voltages, and numerical solutions are obtained for large voltages. The "weakly nonlinear" limit of thin double layers is then analyzed by matched asymptotic expansions in the small parameter epsilon= lambdaD/L, where lambdaD is the screening length and L the electrode separation. At leading order, the system initially behaves like an RC circuit with a response time of lambdaDL/D (not lambdaD2/D), where D is the ionic diffusivity, but nonlinearity violates this common picture and introduces multiple time scales. The charging process slows down, and neutral-salt adsorption by the diffuse part of the double layer couples to bulk diffusion at the time scale, L2/D. In the "strongly nonlinear" regime (controlled by a dimensionless parameter resembling the Dukhin number), this effect produces bulk concentration gradients, and, at very large voltages, transient space charge. The article concludes with an overview of more general situations involving surface conduction, multicomponent electrolytes, and Faradaic processes.},

Due to the complexity of the equations a linearization of the equations was proposed and a closed form solution of the problem was obtained. Newtonian method is applied in order to obtain the impact force and the time duration. The closed-form solution enables one to parametrically study the impact and the related quantities. Finally the results from the analytical solution are validated by the finite element method and also are compared with the results presented in Young (2003).

@article{Stern1990,
abstract = {The consequences of cardiac excitation-contraction coupling by calcium-induced calcium release were studied theoretically, using a series of idealized models solved by analytic and numerical methods. "Common-pool" models, those in which the trigger calcium and released calcium pass through a common cytosolic pool, gave nearly all-or-none regenerative calcium releases (in disagree- ment with experiment), unless their loop gain was made sufficiently low that it provided little amplification of the calcium entering through the sarcolemma. In the linear (small trigger) limit, it was proven rigorously that no common-pool model can give graded high amplification unless it is operated on the verge of spontaneous oscillation. To circumvent this problem, we considered two types of "local-control" models. In the first type, the local calcium from a sarcolemmal L-type calcium channel directly stimulates a single, immediately opposed SR calcium release channel. This permits high amplification without regeneration, but requires high conductance of the SR channel. This problem is avoided in the second type of local control model, in which one L-type channel triggers a regenerative cluster of several SR channels. Statistical recruitment of clusters results in graded response with high amplification. In either type of local-control model, the voltage dependence of SR calcium release is not exactly the same as that of the macroscopic sarcolemmal calcium current, even though calcium is the only trigger for SR release. This results from the existence of correlations between the stochastic openings of individual sarcolemmal and SR channels. Propagation of regenerative calcium-release waves (under conditions of calcium overload) was analyzed using analytically soluble models in which SR calcium release was treated phenomenalogically. The range of wave velocities observed experimentally is easily explained; however, the observed degree of refractoriness to wave propagation requires either a strong depen- dence of SR calcium release on the rate of rise of cytosolic calcium or localization of SR release sites to one point in the sarcomere. We conclude that the macroscopic behavior of calcium-induced calcium release depends critically on the spatial relationships among sarcolemmal and SR calcium channels, as well as on their kinetics.},

abstract = {We have examined the effect of cortical spreading depression (SD) and anoxic depolarization (AD) on the interstitial concentration changes of amino acids (AA) in the neocortex of anesthetized rats using microdialysis and HPLC. Accompanying SD alanine increased to 126±11\%, arginine to 116±3\%, asparate to 160±17\%, glutamate to 163±9\%, glycine to 158±21\%, serine to 125±9\%, and taurine to 172±15\% (mean ± 1 S.E.M.). The increases lasted for about 1 min. Histidine decreased to 74\%±4\% at 1 min following SD, and returned to normal 4 min later. Cardiac arrest triggered AD after approximately 2 min, immediately followed by changes of interstitial AAs. At 5 min after AD alanine had increased to 183±13\%, aspartate to 3,458±656\%, GABA to 338±35\%, glutamate to 1,696±546\%, glycine to 297±37\%, serine to 153±12\%, and taurine to 1721±98\% as compared to control values (mean ± 1 S.E.M.). Histidine decreased to 78±2\% at 3 min following AD while arginine exhibited insignificant variations around the baseline. The increase of glutamate during SD is consistent with activation of NMDA-receptors as an essential requirement for this reaction. The increase of AAs may also contribute to the sequence of events leading to AD, though the exact mechanism remains unknown. SD is an important pathophysiological mechanism of the ischemic penumbra associated with focal cerebral ischemia, while AD reflects the electrophysiological status of the infarct core. The brief duration of the AA increase during SD may explain survival of cells in the penumbra zone in contrast to the cell death in the infarct center in accord with the excitotoxic hypothesis of ischemic cell death. © 1993.},

abstract = {Red blood cells (RBCs) have highly deformable viscoelastic membranes exhibiting complex rheological response and rich hydrodynamic behavior governed by special elastic and bending properties and by the external/internal fluid and membrane viscosities. We present a multiscale RBC model that is able to predict RBC mechanics, rheology, and dynamics in agreement with experiments. Based on an analytic theory, the modeled membrane properties can be uniquely related to the experimentally established RBC macroscopic properties without any adjustment of parameters. The RBC linear and nonlinear elastic deformations match those obtained in optical-tweezers experiments. The rheological properties of the membrane are compared with those obtained in optical magnetic twisting cytometry, membrane thermal fluctuations, and creep followed by cell recovery. The dynamics of RBCs in shear and Poiseuille flows is tested against experiments and theoretical predictions, and the applicability of the latter is discussed. Our findings clearly indicate that a purely elastic model for the membrane cannot accurately represent the RBC's rheological properties and its dynamics, and therefore accurate modeling of a viscoelastic membrane is necessary. © 2010 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {The rabbit inferior vena cava (IVC) is a large-capacitance vessel that displays typical contractile dose-response curves for caffeine and phenylephrine (PE). Using confocal microscopy on the endothelium-denuded IVC, we undertook experiments to correlate these whole-tissue contractile dose-response curves with changes in subcellular [Ca(2+)](i) signals in the in situ vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). We observed that both caffeine and PE initially elicited Ca(2+) waves in individual VSMCs. The [Ca(2+)](i) in cells challenged with caffeine subsequently returned to baseline whereas the [Ca(2+)](i) in cells challenged with PE exhibited repetitive asynchronous Ca(2+) waves. These [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations were related to Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum as they were inhibited by ryanodine and caffeine. The lack of synchronicity of the [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations between VSMCs can explain the observed tonic contraction at the whole-tissue level. The nature of these Ca(2+) waves was further characterized. For caffeine, the amplitude was all-or-none in nature, with individual cells differing in sensitivity, leading to their recruitment at different concentrations of the agonist. This concentration dependency of recruitment appears to form the basis for the concentration dependency of caffeine-induced contraction. Furthermore, the speed of the Ca(2+) waves correlated positively with the concentration of caffeine. In the case of PE, we observed the same characteristics with respect to wave speed, amplitude, and recruitment. Increasing concentrations of PE also enhance the frequency of the [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. We therefore conclude that PE stimulates whole-tissue contractility through differential recruitment of VSMCs and enhancement of the frequency of asynchronous [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations once the cells are recruited.},

abstract = {Defining the microanatomic differences between the human brain and that of other mammals is key to understanding its unique computational power. Although much effort has been devoted to comparative studies of neurons, astrocytes have received far less attention. We report here that protoplasmic astrocytes in human neocortex are 2.6-fold larger in diameter and extend 10-fold more GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein)-positive primary processes than their rodent counterparts. In cortical slices prepared from acutely resected surgical tissue, protoplasmic astrocytes propagate Ca(2+) waves with a speed of 36 microm/s, approximately fourfold faster than rodent. Human astrocytes also transiently increase cystosolic Ca(2+) in response to glutamatergic and purinergic receptor agonists. The human neocortex also harbors several anatomically defined subclasses of astrocytes not represented in rodents. These include a population of astrocytes that reside in layers 5-6 and extend long fibers characterized by regularly spaced varicosities. Another specialized type of astrocyte, the interlaminar astrocyte, abundantly populates the superficial cortical layers and extends long processes without varicosities to cortical layers 3 and 4. Human fibrous astrocytes resemble their rodent counterpart but are larger in diameter. Thus, human cortical astrocytes are both larger, and structurally both more complex and more diverse, than those of rodents. On this basis, we posit that this astrocytic complexity has permitted the increased functional competence of the adult human brain.},

@article{Barrett1982,
abstract = {Many cell types possess a Ca-activated K conductance which gives rise to an hyperpolarization following Ca injection or Ca entry during an action potential (Meech \& Strumwasser, 1970; Meech \& Standen, 1975; Heyer \& Lux, 1976a, b; Barrett \& Barrett, 1976; Eckert \& Tillotson, 1978; Gorman \& Thomas, 1980). The magnitude of this Ca-activated K conductance has been reported to be linearly related to the intracellular concentration of Ca, [Ca]i, in Aplysia neurones (Gorman \& Thomas, 1980) and related to the third power of [Ca]i in snail neurones (Meech \& Thomas, 1980). Increased [Ca]i appears to depress this conductance in snail neurones (Heyer \& Lux, 1976a, b) and depolarization increases the magnitude of the conductance in mollusc neurones (Heyer \& Lux, 1976a, b; Gorman \& Thomas, 1980) and neuroblastoma cells (Moolenaar \& Spector, 1979). Using the patch clamp technique (Hamill, Marty, Neher, Sakmann \& Sigworth, 1981), the single channel currents which underlie the Ca-activated K current have recently been observed in patches of membrane excised from snail neurones (Lux, *Neher \& Marty, 1981), chromaffin cells (Marty, 1981) and embryonic rat skeletal muscle cells grown in tissue culture (Pallotta, Magleby \& Barrett, 1981). In this paper we extend our observations on the properties of individual Ca-activated K channels in cultured rat muscle cells; We find that Ca at the intracellular membrane surface activates the channel and describe how the Ca sensitivity is shifted by changes in membrane potential. We show that the channels in a patch open and close independently of one another, and that single channel conductance is independent of [Ca]i (04 /IM to 1 mM) and membrane potential (-50 mV to + 50 mV), but does increase with temperature. In addition, data are presented which suggest that there are three open states of the channel, two with different mean open times and one with a reduced conductance. A preliminary report of some of these results has appeared (Pallotta, Magleby \& Barrett, 1982).},

abstract = {Glycogenolytic agonists induce coordinated Ca(2+) oscillations in multicellular rat hepatocyte systems as well as in the intact liver. The coordination of intercellular Ca(2+) signals requires functional gap-junction coupling. The mechanisms ensuring this coordination are not precisely known. We investigated possible roles of Ca(2+) or inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) as a coordinating messengers for Ca(2+) spiking among connected hepatocytes. Application of ionomycin or of supra-maximal concentrations of agonists show that Ca(2+) does not significantly diffuse between connected hepatocytes, although gap junctions ensure the passage of small signaling molecules, as demonstrated by FRAP experiments. By contrast, coordination of Ca(2+) spiking among connected hepatocytes can be favored by a rise in the level of InsP(3), via the increase of agonist concentrations, or by a shift in the affinity of InsP(3) receptor for InsP(3). In the same line, coordination cannot be achieved if the InsP(3) is rapidly metabolized by InsP(3)-phosphatase in one cell of the multiplet. These results demonstrate that even if small amounts of Ca(2+) diffuse across gap junctions, they most probably do not play a significant role in inducing a coordinated Ca(2+) signal among connected hepatocytes. By contrast, coordination of Ca(2+) oscillations is fully dependent on the diffusion of InsP(3) between neighboring cells.},

The relevant invariant manifolds in phase space are visualized. A geometrical model inspired by the numerical studies displays the sharp turns of the homoclinic bifurcations curves and yields quantitative predictions about multi-pulse and homoclinic orbits and periodic orbits that have not been resolved in the FitzHugh-Nagumo model.

With advancing age, VR spaces are found with increasing frequency and larger apparent sizes. At visual analysis, the signal intensity of VR spaces is identical to that of cerebrospinal fluid with all magnetic resonance imaging sequences. Dilated VR spaces typically occur in three characteristic locations: Type I VR spaces appear along the lenticulostriate arteries entering the basal ganglia through the anterior perforated substance. Type II VR spaces are found along the paths of the perforating medullary arteries as they enter the cortical gray matter over the high convexities and extend into the white matter. Type III VR spaces appear in the midbrain. Occasionally, VR spaces have an atypical appearance. They may become very large, predominantly involve one hemisphere, assume bizarre configurations, and even cause mass effect. Knowledge of the signal intensity characteristics and locations of VR spaces helps differentiate them from various pathologic conditions, including lacunar infarctions, cystic periventricular leukomalacia, multiple sclerosis, cryptococcosis, mucopolysaccharidoses, cystic neoplasms, neurocysticercosis, arachnoid cysts, and neuroepithelial cysts.},

abstract = {95389476 Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City 52242, USA BACKGROUND: Hyperpolarization of vascular muscle in response to activation of potassium channels is a major mechanism of vasodilatation. In cerebral blood vessels, four different potassium channels have been described: ATP-sensitive potassium channels, calcium-activated potassium channels, delayed rectifier potassium channels, and inward rectifier potassium channels. SUMMARY OF REVIEW: Activation of ATP-sensitive and calcium activated potassium channels appears to play a major role in relaxation of cerebral arteries and arterioles in response to diverse stimuli, including receptor-mediated agonists, intracellular second messengers, and hypoxia. Both calcium- activated and delayed rectifier potassium channels may contribute to a negative feedback system that regulates tone in large cerebral arteries. The influence of ATP-sensitive and calcium- activated potassium channels is altered in disease states such as hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: Activation of potassium channels is a major mechanism of cerebral vasodilatation. Alteration of activity of potassium channels and impairment of vasodilatation may contribute to the development or maintenance of cerebral ischemia or vasospasm.

abstract = {Barnacle muscle fibers subjected to constant current stimulation produce a variety of types of oscillatory behavior when the internal medium contains the Ca++ chelator EGTA. Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time during cellular activity), a system dominated by two noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and bistable behavior. © 1981, The Biophysical Society.

abstract = {Cortical spreading depression is a slowly propagating wave of near-complete depolarization of brain cells followed by temporary suppression of neuronal activity. Accumulating evidence indicates that cortical spreading depression underlies the migraine aura and that similar waves promote tissue damage in stroke, trauma, and hemorrhage. Cortical spreading depression is characterized by neuronal swelling, profound elevation of extracellular potassium and glutamate, multiphasic blood flow changes, and drop in tissue oxygen tension. The slow speed of the cortical spreading depression wave implies that it is mediated by diffusion of a chemical substance, yet the identity of this substance and the pathway it follows are unknown. Intercellular spread between gap junction-coupled neurons or glial cells and interstitial diffusion of K(+) or glutamate have been proposed. Here we use extracellular direct current potential recordings, K(+)-sensitive microelectrodes, and 2-photon imaging with ultrasensitive Ca(2+) and glutamate fluorescent probes to elucidate the spatiotemporal dynamics of ionic shifts associated with the propagation of cortical spreading depression in the visual cortex of adult living mice. Our data argue against intercellular spread of Ca(2+) carrying the cortical spreading depression wavefront and are in favor of interstitial K(+) diffusion, rather than glutamate diffusion, as the leading event in cortical spreading depression.},

abstract = {As the red cell emerges from the bone marrow, it loses its nucleus, ribosomes, and mitochondria and therefore all capacity for protein synthesis. However, because of the high O2tension in arterial blood and heme Fe content, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are continuously produced within red cells. Erythrocytes transport large amount of oxygen over their lifespan resulting in oxidative stress. Various factors can lead to the generation of oxidizing radicals such as O2•-, H2O2, HO•in erythrocytes. Evidence indicates that many physiological and pathological conditions such as aging, inflammation, eryptosis develop through ROS action. As such, red cells have potent antioxidant protection consisting of enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways that modify highly ROS into substantially less reactive intermediates. The object of this review is to shed light on the role of ROS both at physiological and pathological levels and the structural requirements of antioxidants for appreciable radical-scavenging activity. Obviously, much is still to be discovered before we clearly understand mechanisms of free radical systems in erythrocytes. Ongoing trends in the field are recognition of undetermined oxidant/antioxidant interactions and elucidation of important signaling networks in radical metabolism. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The partition coefficients are by far the major determinants of the relative magnitudes of the permeability coefficients; the diffusion coefficients make only a minor contribution. We note that the recent emphasis on theoretically calculated intramembranous diffusion coefficients (Dm'S) has diverted attention from the experimentally measurable and physiologically relevant permeability coefficients (Pd'S) and has obscured the simplicity and usefulness of Overton's rule.},

abstract = {This report presents a complete discussion of a method for calculating potential flow about arbitrary lifting three-dimensional bodies without the approximations inherent in lifting-surface theories. The basic formulation of three-dimensional lifting flow is pursued at some length and some difficulties are pointed out. All aspects of the flow calculation method are discussed, and alternate procedures for various aspects of the calculation are compared and evaluated. Particular emphasis is placed on the handling of the bound vorticity and the application of the Kutta condition, and it is concluded that the approach used in the method of this report has certain advantages over alternate schemes used by other existing methods. A considerable number of calculated results for various configurations are presented to illustrate the power and scope of the method. Included are: wing-fuselages, a wing with endplates, and a wing-fuselage with external stores. For some configurations, wind tuinnel data are available for comparison witn the calculated results. Any discrepancy between calculation and experiment appears to be due to viscosity, which is rather important in lifting cases.},

abstract = {Migraine attacks with auras are sometimes associated with underlying hereditary or acquired cerebrovascular disorders. A unifying pathophysiological explanation linking migraine to these conditions has been diffcult to identify. On the basis of genetic and epidemiological evidence, we suggest that changes in blood vessels, hypoperfusion disorders, and microembolisation can cause neurovascular dysfunction and evoke cortical spreading depression, an event that is widely thought to underlie aura symptoms. In fact, recent experimental data have indicated that focal, mild, and transient ischaemia can trigger cortical spreading depression without an enduring tissue signature. Although migraine with aura has many causes (eg, neuronal network excitability), it seems that migraine and stroke might both be triggered by hypoperfusion and could therefore exist on a continuum of vascular complications in a subset of patients who have these hereditary or acquired comorbid vascular conditions.},

abstract = {The cellular mechanisms that couple activity of glutamatergic synapses with changes in blood flow, measured by a variety of techniques including the BOLD signal, have not previously been modelled. Here we provide such a model, that successfully accounts for the main observed changes in blood flow in both visual cortex and somatosensory cortex following their stimulation by high-contrast drifting grating or by single whisker stimulation, respectively. Coupling from glutamatergic synapses to smooth muscle cells of arterioles is effected by astrocytes releasing epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) onto them, following glutamate stimulation of the astrocyte. Coupling of EETs to the smooth muscle of arterioles is by means of potassium channels in their membranes, leading to hyperpolarization, relaxation and hence an increase in blood flow. This model predicts a linear increase in blood flow with increasing numbers of activated astrocytes, but a non-linear increase with increasing glutamate release. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Finally, we comment on future ap- proaches and models to better define, at the cellular and molecular level, the underlying mechanisms between BBB breakdown and neurodegeneration as a basis for developing new therapies for BBB repair to control neurodegeneration.},

abstract = {To gain insight into the role of epithelial ion channels, pumps, and cotransporters in regulating airway water and mucociliary transport, we administered inhibitors of the Na+ channel (amiloride), 3Na-2K-adenosinetriphosphatase (acetylstrophanthidin), and Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (furosemide) to anesthetized dogs and/or baboons. Tracheal ciliary beat frequency was measured by using heterodyne laser light scattering. Tracheal mucus velocity (TMV) and bronchial mucociliary clearance (BMC) or lung mucociliary clearance were measured by using radioaerosols and nuclear imaging. Respiratory tract fluid output was collected by using a secretion-collecting endotracheal tube. In six dogs, amiloride aerosol -lung deposition, 96 +/- 11 microg (means +/- SE)- had minimal effect, whereas acetylstrophanthidin aerosol (lung deposition, 71 +/- 9 microg) increased BMC, and furosemide (40 mg iv) markedly increased TMV. In five baboons, TMV increased after iv furosemide administration (2 mg/kg) as well as by aerosol (lung deposition, 20 +/- 3 mg), coincident with increases in ciliary-mucus coupling from 11.5 +/- 0. 1 to 29.5 +/- 0.4 and 46.5 +/- 0.7 microm/beat, respectively. Furosemide also increased lung mucociliary clearance in baboons. In dogs, respiratory tract fluid output increased after intravenous furosemide from 2.2 +/- 0.5 to 6.8 +/- 1.7 mg/min. When combined with dry-air inhalation, furosemide failed to stimulate TMV and reversed the inhibition of BMC by dry air. Thus pharmacological manipulation of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter and the 3Na-2K-adenosinetriphosphatase pump may provide increases of clinical relevance in airway hydration and mucociliary transport.},

The mechanisms underlying inflammation-induced enteric neuron death are unknown. Here using in vivo models of experimental colitis we report that inflammation causes enteric neuron death by activating a neuronal signaling complex composed of P2X7 receptors (P2X7Rs), pannexin-1 (Panx1) channels, the Asc adaptor protein and caspases. Inhibition of P2X7R, Panx1, Asc or caspase activity prevented inflammation-induced neuron cell death. Preservation of enteric neurons by inhibiting Panx1 in vivo prevented the onset of inflammation-induced colonic motor dysfunction. Panx1 expression was reduced in Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis. We conclude that activation of neuronal Panx1 underlies neuron death and the subsequent development of abnormal gut motility in IBD. Targeting Panx1 represents a new neuroprotective strategy to ameliorate the progression of IBD-associated dysmotility.},

abstract = {Calcium buffers are important for shaping and localizing cytoplasmic Ca2+ transients in neurons. We measured the concentrations of the four main calcium-buffering proteins (calbindin-D28k, calretinin, parvalbumin-alpha, and parvalbumin-beta) in rat cochlear hair cells in which Ca2+ signaling is a central element of fast transduction and synaptic transmission. The proteins were quantified by calibrating immunogold tissue counts against gels containing known amounts of each protein, and the method was verified by application to Purkinje cells in which independent estimates exist for some of the protein concentrations. The results showed that, in animals with fully developed hearing, inner hair cells had 110 of the proteinaceous calcium buffer of outer hair cells in which the cell body contained parvalbumin-beta (oncomodulin) and calbindin-D28k at levels equivalent to 5 mm calcium-binding sites. Both proteins were partially excluded from the hair bundles, which may permit fast unbuffered Ca2+ regulation of the mechanotransducer channels. The sum of the calcium buffer concentrations decreased in inner hair cells and increased in outer hair cells as the cells developed their adult properties during cochlear maturation. The results suggest that Ca2+ has distinct roles in the two types of hair cell, reflecting their different functions in auditory transduction. Ca2+ is used in inner hair cells primarily for fast phase-locked synaptic transmission, whereas Ca2+ may be involved in regulating the motor capability underlying cochlear amplification of the outer hair cell. The high concentration of calcium buffer in outer hair cells, similar only to skeletal muscle, may protect against deleterious consequences of Ca2+ loading after acoustic overstimulation.},

It is designed to introduce cell biology and neuroscience students to computational modeling, and applied mathematics students, theoretical biologists, and engineers to many of the problems in dynamical cell biology. This volume was conceived of and begun by Professor Joel Keizer based on his many years of teaching and research together with his colleagues. The project was expanded and finished by his students and friends after his untimely death in 1999. Carefully selected examples are used to motivate the concepts and techniques of computational cell biology, through a progression of increasingly more complex and demanding cases. Illustrative exercises are included with every chapter, and mathematical and computational appendices are provided for reference. This textbook will be useful for advanced undergraduate and graduate theoretical biologists, and for mathematic students and life scientists who wish to learn about modeling in cell biology. "What better tribute to the late Joel Keizer than to expand his unfinished accounts of teaching and research to a splendid book. Computational Cell Biology performs much more than it promises, for it also deals with considerable analytical material and with aspects of molecular biology.

abstract = {The mammalian brain is supplied with blood by specialized vasculature that is structurally and functionally distinct from that of the periphery. A defining feature of this vasculature is a physical blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB separates blood components from the brain microenvironment, regulating the entry and exit of ions, nutrients, macromolecules, and energy metabolites. Over the last two decades, physiological studies of cerebral blood flow dynamics have demonstrated that substantial intercellular communication occurs between cells of the vasculature and the neurons and glia that abut the vasculature. These findings suggest that the BBB does not function independently, but as a module within the greater context of a multicellular neurovascular unit (NVU) that includes neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, and microglia as well as the blood vessels themselves. Here, we describe the roles of these NVU components as well as how they act in concert to modify cerebrovascular function and permeability in health and in select diseases.},

abstract = {Astrocytes are specialized glial cells that outnumber neurons by over fivefold. They contiguously tile the entire central nervous system (CNS) and exert many essential complex functions in the healthy CNS. Astrocytes respond to all forms of CNS insults through a process referred to as reactive astrogliosis, which has become a pathological hallmark of CNS structural lesions. Substantial progress has been made recently in determining functions and mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis and in identifying roles of astrocytes in CNS disorders and pathologies. A vast molecular arsenal at the disposal of reactive astrocytes is being defined. Transgenic mouse models are dissecting specific aspects of reactive astrocytosis and glial scar formation in vivo. Astrocyte involvement in specific clinicopathological entities is being defined. It is now clear that reactive astrogliosis is not a simple all-or-none phenomenon but is a finely gradated continuum of changes that occur in context-dependent manners regulated by specific signaling events. These changes range from reversible alterations in gene expression and cell hypertrophy with preservation of cellular domains and tissue structure, to long-lasting scar formation with rearrangement of tissue structure. Increasing evidence points towards the potential of reactive astrogliosis to play either primary or contributing roles in CNS disorders via loss of normal astrocyte functions or gain of abnormal effects. This article reviews (1) astrocyte functions in healthy CNS, (2) mechanisms and functions of reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation, and (3) ways in which reactive astrocytes may cause or contribute to specific CNS disorders and lesions.},

abstract = {A system of differential equations describing stationary vasomotion is formulated. It incorporates the ionic transports, cell-membrane potential, muscle contraction of the vessel smooth muscle cells, and the mechanics of a thick-walled cylinder. It is shown that the interaction of Ca2+ and K+ fluxes mediated by voltage-gated and voltage-calcium-gated channels, respectively, brings about periodicity of those transports. This results on a time-periodic cytoplasmic calcium concentration, myosin light chains phosphorylation, and crossbridges formation with the attending muscle stress. The vessel's transmural pressure determines a hoop stress. The resultant hoop, elastic, and muscle stresses determine the rate of change of the vessel's diameter: vasomotion. The model results agree with the experimental observations. The sensitivity of the vasomotion's dependence on parameter values and its significance to experimental protocols are examined. Further, it is hypothesized that the dependence of calcium-channel openings on voltage is shifted by changes on transmural pressure. Thus, Harder's experimental results are reproduced, among them the decreasing of vessel diameter with increasing pressure. Those behaviors are associated with a pattern of change of the singularities of the system of equations describing the model. This suggests a functional relationship on the interactions of Ca2+ and K+ fluxes responsible for the myogenic response; it may not result from a single molecular mechanism. The model is constructed so that additional experimental information can be readily incorporated.},

abstract = {Glial cells, consisting of microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte lineage cells as their major components, constitute a large fraction of the mammalian brain. Originally considered as purely non-functional glue for neurons, decades of research have highlighted the importance as well as further functions of glial cells. Although many aspects of these cells are well characterized nowadays, the functions of the different glial populations in the brain under both physiological and pathological conditions remain, at least to a certain extent, unresolved. To tackle these important questions, a broad range of depletion approaches have been developed in which microglia, astrocytes, or oligodendrocyte lineage cells (i.e., NG2-glia and oligodendrocytes) are specifically ablated from the adult brain network with a subsequent analysis of the consequences. As the different glial populations are very heterogeneous, it is imperative to specifically ablate single cell populations instead of inducing cell death in all glial cells in general. Thanks to modern genetic manipulation methods, the approaches can now directly be targeted to the cell type of interest making the ablation more specific compared to general cell ablation approaches that have been used earlier on. In this review, we will give a detailed summary on different glial ablation studies, focusing on the adult mouse central nervous system and the functional readouts. We will also provide an outlook on how these approaches could be further exploited in the future.},

abstract = {A substantial body of evidence supports the hypothesis of a vascular component in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebral hypoperfusion and blood-brain barrier dysfunction have been indicated as key elements of this pathway. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a cerebrovascular disorder, frequent in AD, characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide in cerebral blood vessel walls. CAA is associated with loss of vascular integrity, resulting in impaired regulation of cerebral circulation, and increased susceptibility to cerebral ischemia, microhemorrhages, and white matter damage. Vasomotion-the spontaneous rhythmic modulation of arterial diameter, typically observed in arteries/arterioles in various vascular beds including the brain-is thought to participate in tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery regulation. Vasomotion is impaired in adverse conditions such as hypoperfusion and hypoxia. The perivascular and glymphatic pathways of Abeta clearance are thought to be driven by the systolic pulse. Vasomotion produces diameter changes of comparable amplitude, however at lower rates, and could contribute to these mechanisms of Abeta clearance. In spite of potential clinical interest, studies addressing cerebral vasomotion in the context of AD/CAA are limited. This study reviews the current literature on vasomotion, and hypothesizes potential paths implicating impaired cerebral vasomotion in AD/CAA. Abeta and oxidative stress cause vascular tone dysregulation through direct effects on vascular cells, and indirect effects mediated by impaired neurovascular coupling. Vascular tone dysregulation is further aggravated by cholinergic deficit and results in depressed cerebrovascular reactivity and (possibly) impaired vasomotion, aggravating regional hypoperfusion and promoting further Abeta and oxidative stress accumulation},

abstract = {In 1972 the Fluid - Mosaic Membrane Model of membrane structure was proposed based on thermodynamic principals of organization of membrane lipids and proteins and available evidence of asymmetry and lateral mobility within the membrane matrix [S. J. Singer and G. L. Nicolson, Science 175 (1972) 720-731]. After over 40 years, this basic model of the cell membrane remains relevant for describing the basic nano-structures of a variety of intracellular and cellular membranes of plant and animal cells and lower forms of life. In the intervening years, however, new information has documented the importance and roles of specialized membrane domains, such as lipid rafts and protein/glycoprotein complexes, in describing the macrostructure, dynamics and functions of cellular membranes as well as the roles of membrane-associated cytoskeletal fences and extracellular matrix structures in limiting the lateral diffusion and range of motion of membrane components. These newer data build on the foundation of the original model and add new layers of complexity and hierarchy, but the concepts described in the original model are still applicable today. In updated versions of the model more emphasis has been placed on the mosaic nature of the macrostructure of cellular membranes where many protein and lipid components are limited in their rotational and lateral motilities in the membrane plane, especially in their natural states where lipid-lipid, protein-protein and lipid-protein interactions as well as cell-matrix, cell-cell and intracellular membrane-associated protein and cytoskeletal interactions are important in restraining the lateral motility and range of motion of particular membrane components. The formation of specialized membrane domains and the presence of tightly packed integral membrane protein complexes due to membrane-associated fences, fenceposts and other structures are considered very important in describing membrane dynamics and architecture. These structures along with membrane-associated cytoskeletal and extracellular structures maintain the long-range, non-random mosaic macro-organization of membranes, while smaller membrane nano- and submicro-sized domains, such as lipid rafts and protein complexes, are important in maintaining specialized membrane structures that are in cooperative dynamic flux in a crowded membrane plane.

We provide a detailed model of potassium flow throughout the neurovascular unit (synaptic region, astrocytes, and arteriole) for the cortex of the young brain. Our model reproduces several phenomena observed experimentally: functional hyperemia, in which neural activity triggers astrocytic potassium release at the perivascular endfoot, inducing arteriole dilation; K+ undershoot in the synaptic space after periods of neural activity; neurally induced astrocyte hyperpolarization during Kir blockade. Our results suggest that the dynamics of the vascular response during functional hyperemia are governed by astrocytic Kir for the fast onset and astrocytic BK for maintaining dilation. The model supports the hypothesis that K+ undershoot is caused by excessive astrocytic uptake through Na-K and NKCC pumps, whereas the effect is balanced by Kir.

abstract = {Many cells exhibit periodic transient increases in cytosolic calcium levels rather than a sustained rise when stimulated by a hormone or growth factor. We propose here a molecular model that accounts for periodic calcium spiking induced by a constant stimulus. Four elements give rise to repetitive calcium transients: cooperativity and positive feedback between a pair of reciprocally coupled (crosscoupled) messengers, followed by deactivation and then by reactivation. The crosscoupled messengers in our model are inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and cytosolic calcium ions. The opening of calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum by the binding of multiple molecules of InsP3 provides the required cooperativity. The stimulation of receptor-activated phospholipase C by released calcium ions leads to positive feedback. InsP3 is destroyed by a phosphatase, and calcium ion is pumped back into the endoplasmic reticulum. These processes generate bistability: the cytosolic calcium concentration abruptly increases from a basal level to a stimulated level at a threshold degree of activation of phospholipase C. Spiking further requires slow deactivation and subsequent reactivation. In our model, mitochondrial sequestration of calcium ion prevents the cytosolic level from increasing above several micromolar and enables the system to return to the basal state. When the endoplasmic reticulum calcium store is refilled to a critical level by the Ca2+-ATPase pump, cooperative positive feedback between the InsP3-gated channel and phospholipase C begins again to give the next calcium spike. The time required for the calcium level in the endoplasmic reticulum to reach a threshold sets the interval between spikes. The amplitude, shape, and period of calcium spikes calculated for this model are like those observed experimentally.},

abstract = {We have developed a mathematical model of arterial vasomotion in which irregular rhythmic activity is generated by the nonlinear interaction of intracellular and membrane oscillators that depend on cyclic release of Ca2+ from internal stores and cyclic influx of extracellular Ca2+, respectively. Four key control variables were selected on the basis of the pharmacological characteristics of histamine-induced vasomotion in rabbit ear arteries: Ca2+ concentration in the cytosol, Ca2+ concentration in ryanodine-sensitive stores, cell membrane potential, and the open state probability of Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Although not represented by independent dynamic variables, the model also incorporates Na+/Ca2+ exchange, the Na+-K+-ATPase, Cl- fluxes, and Ca2+ efflux via the extrusion ATPase. Simulations reproduce a wide spectrum of experimental observations, including 1) the effects of interventions that modulate the functionality of Ca2+ stores and membrane ion channels, 2) paradoxes such as the apparently unpredictable dual action of Ca2+ antagonists and low extracellular Na+ concentration, which can abolish vasomotion or promote the appearance of large-amplitude oscillations, and 3) period-doubling, quasiperiodic, and intermittent routes to chaos. Nonlinearity is essential to explain these diverse patterns of experimental vascular response.},

abstract = {Preceded by a companion paper on Galvani's life, this article is written on the occasion of the bicentenary of the death of Luigi Galvani. From his studies on the effects of electricity on frogs, the scientist of Bologna derived the hypothesis that animal tissues are endowed with an intrinsic electricity that is involved in fundamental physiological processes such as nerve conduction and muscle contraction. Galvani's work swept away from life sciences mysterious fluids and elusive entities like "animal spirits" and led to the foundation of a new science, electrophysiology. Two centuries of research work have demonstrated how insightful was Galvani's conception of animal electricity. Nevertheless, the scholar of Bologna is still largely misrepresented in the history of science, because the importance of his researches seems to be limited to the fact that they opened the paths to the studies of the physicist Alessandro Volta, which culminated in 1800 with the invention of the electric battery. Volta strongly opposed Galvani's theories on animal electricity. The matter of the scientific controversy between Galvani and Volta is examined here in the light of two centuries of electrophysiological studies leading to the modern understanding of electrical excitability in nerve and muscle. By surveying the work of scientists such as Nobili, Matteucci, du Bois-Reymond, von Helmholtz, Bernstein, Hermann, Lucas, Adrian, Hodgkin, Huxley, and Katz, the real matter of the debate raised by Galvani's discoveries is here reconsidered. In addition, a revolutionary phase of the 18th century science that opened the way for the development of modern neurosciences is reevaluated.},

abstract = {Effective Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations are derived for macroscopic ion transport in charged porous media. Homogenization analysis is performed for a two-component pe- riodic composite consisting of a dilute electrolyte continuum (described by standard PNP equations) and a continuous dielectric matrix, which is impermeable to the ions and carries a given surface charge. Three new features arise in the upscaled equations: (i) the effective ionic diffusivities and mobilities become tensors, related to the microstructure; (ii) the effective permittivity is also a tensor, depending on the electrolyte/matrix permittivity ratio and the ratio of the Debye screening length to mean pore size; and (iii) the surface charge per volume appears as a continuous "background charge density". The coeffcient tensors in the macroscopic PNP equations can be calculated from periodic reference cell problem, and several examples are considered. For an insulating solid matrix, all gradients are corrected by a single tortuosity tensor, and the Einstein relation holds at the macroscopic scale, which is not generally the case for a polarizable matrix. In the limit of thin double layers, Poisson's equation is replaced by macroscopic electroneutrality (balancing ionic and surface charges). The general form of the macroscopic PNP equations may also hold for concentrated solution theories, based on the local-density and mean-field approximations. These results have broad applicability to ion transport in porous electrodes, separators, membranes, ion-exchange resins, soils, porous rocks, and biological tissues.},

abstract = {Red blood cells (RBCs) possess a unique capacity for undergoing cellular deformation to navigate across various human microcirculation vessels, enabling them to pass through capillaries that are smaller than their diameter and to carry out their role as gas carriers between blood and tissues. Since there is growing evidence that red blood cell deformability is impaired in some pathological conditions, measurement of RBC deformability has been the focus of numerous studies over the past decades. Nevertheless, reports on healthy and pathological RBCs are currently limited and, in many cases, are not expressed in terms of well-defined cell membrane parameters such as elasticity and viscosity. Hence, it is often difficult to integrate these results into the basic understanding of RBC behaviour, as well as into clinical applications. The aim of this review is to summarize currently available reports on RBC deformability and to highlight its association with various human diseases such as hereditary disorders (e.g., spherocytosis, elliptocytosis, ovalocytosis, and stomatocytosis), metabolic disorders (e.g., diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, obesity), adenosine triphosphate-induced membrane changes, oxidative stress, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Microfluidic techniques have been identified as the key to develop state-of-the-art dynamic experimental models for elucidating the significance of RBC membrane alterations in pathological conditions and the role that such alterations play in the microvasculature flow dynamics.},

During TBI, gap junctions are especially involved in the intercellular molecule trafficking on repair of blood vessels and the regulation of vasomotor tone. Furthermore, gliosis and astrocytic swelling due to mechanical strain injury point out the consequences of derailed gap junction communication.

abstract = {Oscillations in cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations in living cells are often a manifestation of propagating waves of Ca2+. Numerical simulations with a realistic model of inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate (IP3)-induced Ca2+ wave trains lead to wave speeds that increase linearly at long times when (a) IP3 levels are in the range for Ca2+ oscillations, (b) a gradient of phase is established by either an initial ramp or pulse of IP3, and (c) IP3 concentrations asymptotically become uniform. We explore this phenomenon with analytical and numerical methods using a simple two-variable reduction of the De Young-Keizer model of the IP3 receptor that includes the influence of Ca2+ buffers. For concentrations of IP3 in the oscillatory regime, numerical solution of the resulting reaction diffusion equations produces nonlinear wave trains that shows the same asymptotic growth of wave speed. Due to buffering, diffusion of Ca2+ is quite slow and, as previously noted, these waves occur without appreciable bulk movement of Ca2+. Thus, following Neu and Murray, we explore the behavior of these waves using an asymptotic expansion based on the small size of the buffered diffusion constant for Ca2+. We find that the gradient in phase of the wave obeys Burgers' equation asymptotically in time. This result is used to explain the linear increase of the wave speed observed in the simulations.},

abstract = {Normal brain function requires proper supply of oxygen and glucose in a timely and local manner. This is achieved through an orchestrated intercellular communication between neurones, astrocytes and microvessels that results in a rapid and restricted increase in cerebral blood flow, a process known as neurovascular coupling. Astrocytic end-feet make close contacts with neuronal synapses and blood vessels and, given their ability to release vasoactive signals following neuronal activation, have been recognized as key intermediaries in the neurovascular response. Both dilating and constricting signals appear to be released from astrocytes upon increases in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration, and both dilatation and constriction of brain vessels have been observed in previous studies. In this article, we discuss the various astrocyte-derived vasodilating and vasoconstricting signals, their interactions and effects on astrocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells, and suggest the importance of the intrinsic properties of the latter cell type on the overall neurovascular response. We present a working model in which the rise in astrocytic Ca(2+) following neuronal activation leads not only to the rapid activation of calcium-activated K(+) channels in astrocytic end-feet, but also to their modulation by metabolites of the arachidonic acid pathway, which in general have been proposed to act on vascular smooth muscle cells rather than on astrocytes. We propose that this latter mechanism may in turn modulate K(+) signalling from astrocytes to smooth muscle cells, influencing the overall effects of the vasodilating and vasoconstricting signals released during neuronal activation.},

From these experiments, the [InsP3]cyt required to evoke a half-maximal calcium response is 100 nM. Experiments with caged glycerophosphoryl-myo-inositol 4, 5-bisphosphate (GPIP2), a slowly metabolized analogue of InsP3, gave a much slower recovery and a half-maximal response of an order of magnitude greater than InsP3. Experimental data and highly constrained variables were used to construct a mathematical model of the InsP3-dependent [Ca2+]cyt changes; the resulting simulations show high fidelity to experiment. Among the elements considered in constructing this model were the mechanism of the InsP3-receptor, InsP3 degradation, calcium buffering in the cytosol, and refilling of the ER stores via sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pumps. The model predicts a time constant of 0.8 s for InsP3 degradation and 13 s for GPIP2. InsP3 degradation was found to be a prerequisite for [Ca2+]cyt recovery to baseline levels and is therefore critical to the pattern of the overall [Ca2+]cyt signal. Analysis of the features of this model provides insights into the individual factors controlling the amplitude and shape of the InsP3-mediated calcium signal.},

We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane together seem sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage as such. However, when taking into account ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na(+)/K(+)/Cl(-) (NKCC1) and the Na(+)/HCO(3) (-) (NBC) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage. Considering the current state of knowledge, the model framework appears sufficiently detailed and constrained to guide future key experiments and pave the way for more comprehensive astroglia-neuron interaction models for normal as well as pathophysiological situations.},

abstract = {In image-guided surgeries (IGSs) and radiology, images are the main source of information. As image data provide the differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues in the human, the images need to be reliable and they need to provide accurate spatial representation of the patient. This research concentrates on the accuracy assessment of IGS devices in general and then specifically on the spatial accuracy of a common magnetic resonance (MR) imager and a mobile three-dimensional surgical computed tomography (CT) scanner. The accuracy assessment tool had been designed to be universal and to enable its use in the hospital setting. In this study, it was used in detecting the spatial accuracy of a commercial surgical CT scanner, the O-arm, and a 1.5-T MR imager. The results show the tendency of magnetic resonance imaging to produce slight decreases in spatial accuracy toward the fringes of the images from the isocenter. Furthermore, the results indicate that the accuracy of both scanners was within pixel size and thus highly accurate in the region of surgical interest of this study.},

abstract = {A series of careful studies has been made on blood damage in a rotational viscometer. Specific attention has been focused on the effects of solid surface interaction, centrifugal force, air interface interaction, mixing of sheared and unsheared layers, cell-cell interaction, and viscous heating. The results show that there is a threshold shear stress, 1500 dynes/cm2, above which extensive cell damage is directly due to shear stress, and the various secondary effects listed above are negligible. By analysis of these results and those of prior workers it is shown that the exposure time-shear stress plane is divided into two distinct regimes. In the regime of relatively low stresses and exposure times there is relatively little damage, and the damage is dominated by solid surface interaction effects. In the other regime, at high stresses and exposure times, stress effects alone dominate and very high rates of hemolysis occur. The experimental findings of all prior workers are shown to be consistent when interpreted in this way. © 1972, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Spreading depression (SD) is a slowly propagating wave of neuronal and glial depolarization lasting a few minutes, that can develop within the cerebral cortex or other brain areas after electrical, mechanical or chemical depolarizing stimulations. Cortical SD (CSD) is considered the neurophysiological correlate of migraine aura. It is characterized by massive increases in both extracellular K⁺ and glutamate, as well as rises in intracellular Na⁺ and Ca²⁺. These ionic shifts produce slow direct current (DC) potential shifts that can be recorded extracellularly. Moreover, CSD is associated with changes in cortical parenchymal blood flow. CSD has been shown to be a common therapeutic target for currently prescribed migraine prophylactic drugs. Yet, no effects have been observed for the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine, consistent with their lack of efficacy on migraine. Some molecules of interest for migraine have been tested for their effect on CSD. Specifically, blocking CSD may play an enabling role for novel benzopyran derivative tonabersat in preventing migraine with aura. Additionally, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists have been recently reported to inhibit CSD, suggesting the contribution of CGRP receptor activation to the initiation and maintenance of CSD not only at the classic vascular sites, but also at a central neuronal level. Understanding what may be lying behind this contribution, would add further insights into the mechanisms of actions for "gepants", which may be pivotal for the effectiveness of these drugs as anti-migraine agents. CSD models are useful tools for testing current and novel prophylactic drugs, providing knowledge on mechanisms of action relevant for migraine.},

Recently, spiral intercellular waves of calcium have been observed in slices of hippocampal tissue. We use an existing model to study the properties of spiral intercellular calcium waves. Although intercellular spiral waves are well known in the context of cardiac muscle, due to the small value of the calcium diffusion coefficient intercellular calcium waves have fundamentally different properties. We show that homogenisation techniques give a good estimate for the plane wave speed, but do not describe spiral behaviour well. Using an expression for the effective diffusion coefficient we estimate the intercellular calcium permeability in liver. For the bistable equation, we derive an analytic estimate for the value of the intercellular permeability at which wave propagation fails. In the calcium wave model, we show numerically that the spiral period is first a decreasing, then an increasing, function of the intercellular permeability. We hypothesise that this is because the curvature of the spiral core is unimportant at low permeability, the period being approximately set instead by the speed of a plane wave along a line of coupled cells in one dimension.},

In Part I the nonlinear oscillations of a spherical gas bubble in an incompressible, viscous liquid are investigated analytically by means of an asymptotic method. The effect of surface tension is included, and it is shown that thermal and acoustic damping can be accounted for by the suitable redefinition of one parameter. Approximate analytical solutions for the steady state oscillations are presented for the fundamental mode as well as for the first and second subharmonic and for the first and second harmonic. The transient behaviour is also briefly considered. The first subharmonic is studied in particular detail, and a new explanation of its connection with acoustic cavitation is proposed. The approximate analytical results are compared with some numerical ones and a good agreement is found. In Part II the characteristics of subharmonic and ultraharmonic modes appearing in the forced, steady state oscillations of weakly nonlinear systems are considered from the physical, rather than mathematical, viewpoint. A simple explanation of the differences between the two modes, and in particular of the threshold effect usually exhibited by subharmonic oscillations, is presented. The principal resonance in the case of weak excitation is also briefly considered. Finally, in Part III the problem of two viscous, incompressible fluids separated by a nearly spherical free surface is considered in general terms as an initial value problem to first order in the perturbation of the spherical symmetry. As an example of the applications of the theory, the free oscillations of a viscous drop are studied in some detail. In particular, it is shown that the normal mode analysis of this problem available in the literature does not furnish a solution correct for all times, but only an asymptotic one valid as [...].},

abstract = {The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation has been investigated with a wide array of different methods in the last three decades. Recently a version of the equations with an applied current was analyzed by Champneys, Kirk, Knobloch, Oldeman and Sneyd using numerical continuation methods. They obtained a complicated bifurcation diagram in parameter space featuring a C-shaped curve of homoclinic bifurcations and a U-shaped curve of Hopf bifurcations. We use techniques from multiple time-scale dynamics to understand the structures of this bifurcation diagram based on geometric singular perturbation analysis of the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. Numerical and analytical techniques show that if the ratio of the time-scales in the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation tends to zero, then our singular limit analysis correctly represents the observed CU-structure. Geometric insight from the analysis can even be used to compute bifurcation curves which are inaccessible via continuation methods. The results of our analysis are summarized in a singular bifurcation diagram.

I will highlight key features of CICR and how they are represented in models as well as the challenges that theoreticians face when translating our current understanding of calcium signals into equations. The selected examples demonstrate that a successful model provides mechanistic insights into the molecular machinery of the Ca²⁺ signaling toolbox and determines the contribution of local Ca²⁺ release to global Ca²⁺ patterns, which at the moment cannot be resolved experimentally.},

abstract = {The principal purpose of this paper is to examine whether membrane stresses can support topographic loads on planetary elastic lithospheres. It is found that the ability of a spherical shell to support loads through membrane stresses is determined by the nondimensional parameter r = Ed/ApgR 2 where d is the thickness of the elastic lithosphere, AO is the density difference between the mantle and crust, and R is the radius of the planetary body. When this parameter is large membrane stresses can fully support topo- graphic loads without flexure, and when it is small the influence of membrane stresses can be neglected. Solutions of the equation governing the behavior of a spherical shell are obtained for a topographic load expressed in terms of spherical harmonics. Spherical harmonic expansions of the measured gravity and topography for Mars and the moon are compared with the theory. It is found that for Mars the support of topography is primarily due to membrane stresses for n < 8 and for the moon for n < 17. For Mars the data for 4 \_< n \_< 7 give •- = 0.5. For the moon the data have considerable scatter that is attributed to the mascons but generally correlate with •- = 0.5. If bending stresses are neglected, the governing equation for the deflection of the spherical shell is Legendre's equation. A general solution is obtained for an ax- isymmetric load. This solution is applied to the Tharsis region on Mars. The 60-65\% compensation of this region requires that •- = 0.6. The well defined fracture pattern surrounding the Tharsis region is at- tributed to tensional membrane stresses. INTRODUCTION},

abstract = {Abstract The recent discovery that the neurotransmitter glutamate can trigger actively propagating Ca2+ waves in the cytoplasm of cultured astrocytes suggests the possibility that synaptically released glutamate may trigger similar Ca2+ waves in brain astrocytes in situ. To explore this possibility, we used confocal microscopy and the Ca2+ indicator fluo-3 to study organotypically cultured slices of rat hippocampus, where astrocytic and neuronal networks are intermingled in their normal tissue relationships. We find that astrocytic Ca2+ waves are present under these circumstances and that these waves can be triggered by the firing of glutamatergic neuronal afferents with latencies as short as 2 s. The Ca2+ waves closely resemble those previously observed in cultured astrocytes: they propagate both within and between astrocytes at velocities of 7–27 $\mu$m/s at 21°C. The ability of tissue astrocyte networks to respond to neuronal network activity suggests that astrocytes may have a much more dynamic and active role in brain function than has been generally recognized.},

abstract = {Deformation of the outermost parts of single-plate planetary bodies is often modelled in terms of the response of a spherical elastic shell to surface or basal loading. As the thickness of such elastic lithosphere is usually much smaller than the radius of the body, the deformation is commonly approximated by that obtained for a thin elastic shell of uniform thickness. The main advantage of the thin shell approximation is its simplicitythe solution can be expressed analytically if the thickness of the shell is uniform, but even in the case of a thin shell of variable thickness, when the problem must be solved numerically, the computational costs are much lower than in a fully 3-D case. Here we analyse the error of the thin shell approximation by comparing it with the solution obtained for a shell of finite thickness using finite element methods. Special attention is paid to a shell of variable thickness and, in general, to the effect of elastic thickness variations on local deformation. For a shell of uniform thickness with the outer radius corresponding to Mars, we find that the error in radial displacement at low harmonic degrees (l= 20) does not exceed 5 per cent for small shell thicknesses (d= 50 km) and 10 per cent for thick shells (d similar to 250 km). Similar accuracy is also found for a shell of variable thickness if the thin shell approximation is used. Our numerical tests indicate that local deformation of a shell is mostly sensitive to the average thickness of the shell in the near zone while the effect of thickness variations in the far zone can be neglected in the first approximation. Consequently, the extremely simple thin shell method, designed for shells of uniform thickness, can be effectively used to obtain a reasonably accurate estimate of deflection even in the case of a shell with varying thickness. Finally, we investigate the deformation of an elastic lithosphere due to viscous flow beneath the shell, and we propose an extension of the concept, recently developed to correct dynamic topography for the effect of an elastic lithosphere, to the case of a shell of variable thickness.},

abstract = {Introduction: Unexplained secondary brain injury often strikes patients in neurointensive care. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) and depolarization waves are associated with dramatic failure of brain ion homeostasis, efflux of excitatory amino acids from nerve cells, increased energy metabolism and changes in cerebral blood flow. Strong clinical and experimental evidence suggests that CSD is involved in the mechanism of stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic brain injury; changes in the composition of the brain extracellular microenvironment and reduced level of brain perfusion may lead to failure of brain energy supply and aggravated outcome. Objectives: To establish the importance of CSD and CSD-like events as a mechanism for secondary deterioration and aggravated long term outcome in acute brain injury. Methods: During operation for acute brain injury, a 6-electrode subdural platinum strip was placed on the perilesion area to allow recording of electrocorticogram for up to 10 days. Microdialysis, partial pressure of oxygen in brain tissue, cerebral blood flow and perfusion pressure were monitored in subsets of patients. Results: CSD and CSD-like events were recorded in 65.9 \% of 220 patients. Clusters of these events were associated with clinical deterioration, increasing lactate and decreasing glucose and dose-dependent decrease of CBF. Prolonged ECoG flattening after CSD was associated with bad outcome. Conclusions: CSD is a pathophysiological mechanism for this group of acute neurological disorders. The findings have implications for monitoring and treatment of patients with acute brain disorders in the intensive care unit. Experimental findings from animal studies of CSD suggest treatment strategies, which may be used to prevent or attenuate secondary neuronal damage in acutely injured human brain cortex caused by depolarization waves.},

abstract = {The skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) was investigated for the presence of well-known endoplasmic reticulum (ER) markers: the lumenal protein BiP and a group of membrane proteins recognized by an antibody raised against ER membrane vesicles. Western blots of SR fractions revealed the presence of BiP in fast- and slow-twitch muscles of the rabbit as well as in rat and chicken muscles. Analyses of purified SR subfractions, together with cryosection immunofluorescence and immunogold labeling, revealed BiP evenly distributed within the longitudinal SR and the terminal cisternae. Within the terminal cisternae BiP appeared not to be mixed with calsequestrin but to be distributed around the aggregates of the latter Ca2+ binding protein. Of the various membrane markers only calnexin (91 kDa) was found to be distributed within both SR subfractions, whereas the other markers (apparent molecular masses of 64 kDa and 58 kDa and a doublet around 28 kDa) were concentrated in the terminal cisternae. These results suggest that the SR is a specialized ER subcompartment in which general markers, such as the ones we have investigated, coexist with the major SR proteins specifically responsible for Ca2+ uptake, storage, and release. The differential distribution of the ER markers reveals new aspects of the SR molecular structure that might be of importance for the functioning of the endomembrane system.},

abstract = {<p>Liquid jetting and fragmentation are important in many industrial and medical applications. Here, we study the jetting from the surface of single liquid droplets undergoing internal volume oscillations. This is accomplished by an explosively expanding and collapsing vapour bubble within the droplet. We observe jets emerging from the droplet surface, which pinch off into finer secondary droplets. The jetting is excited by the spherical Rayleigh–Taylor instability where the radial acceleration is due to the oscillation of an internal bubble. We study this jetting and the effect of fluid viscosity experimentally and numerically. Experiments are carried out by levitating the droplet in an acoustic trap and generating a laser-induced cavitation bubble near the centre of the droplet. On the simulation side, the volume of fluid method (OpenFOAM) solves the compressible Navier–Stokes equations while accounting for surface tension and viscosity. Both two-dimensional (2-D) axisymmetric and 3-D simulations are performed and show good agreement with each other and the experimental observation. While the axisymmetric simulation reveals how the bubble dynamics results destabilizes the interface, only the 3-D simulation computes the geometrically correct slender jets. Overall, experiments and simulations show good agreement for the bubble dynamics, the onset of disturbances and the rapid ejection of filaments after bubble collapse. Additionally, an analytic model for the droplet surface perturbation growth is developed based on the spherical Rayleigh–Taylor instability analysis, which allows us to evaluate the surface stability over a large parameter space. The analytic model predicts correctly the onset of jetting as a function of Reynolds number and normalized internal bubble energy.</p>},

abstract = {Calcium cycling between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and the cytosol via the SR/ER Ca-ATPase (SERCA) pump, inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) and Ryanodine receptor (RyR), plays a major role in alpha-1 adrenergic agonist induced intracellular calcium ( Ca2+ cyt) dynamics in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Levels of these calcium handling proteins in SR get altered under disease conditions. We have developed a mathematical model to understand the significance of altered levels of SERCA, IP3R and RyR on the intracellular calcium dynamics of VSMC; first such kind of numerical study. SR is modelled as a single continuous entity with homogeneous luminal calcium. Model results show that SERCA, IP3R and RyR levels in VMSC plays an important role to decide intracellular calcium state either steady or oscillatory. It is found that lowering SERCA level will enable calcium oscillations at a low agonist concentrations whereas reduced levels of IP3R and RyR need higher agonist concentration for intracellular calcium oscillations. This research propose that if unwanted intracellular calcium dynamics are produced due to disturbed agonist concentration, VSMC can self-regulate that by altering levels of SERCA, IP3R and RyR. The model results provide an insight into the presence of altered levels of SERCA, IP3R and RyR in VSMCs under disease conditions.},

We show that, for a given level of glutamatergic synaptic activity, corticocortical and thalamocortical inputs evoked activity in pyramidal cells and different classes of interneurons, and produced different changes in oxygen consumption and CBF. Furthermore, increases in stimulation intensities either turned off or activated additional classes of inhibitory interneurons immunoreactive for different vasoactive molecules, which may contribute to increases in CBF. Our data imply that for a given cortical area, the amplitude of vascular signals will depend critically on the type of input, and that a positive blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal may be a consequence of the activation of both pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons.},

abstract = {Spontaneous, rhythmical contractions, or vasomotion, can be recorded from cerebral vessels under both normal physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Using electrophysiology to study changes in membrane potential, the ratiometric calcium indicator Fura-2 AM to study changes in [Ca(2+)](i) in both the arterial wall and in individual smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and video microscopy to study changes in vessel diameter, we have investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying vasomotion in the juvenile rat basilar artery. During vasomotion, rhythmical oscillations in both membrane potential and [Ca(2+)](i) were found to precede rhythmical contractions. Nifedipine depolarized SMCs and abolished rhythmical contractions and depolarizations. [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations in the arterial wall became reduced and irregular, while [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations in adjacent SMCs were no longer synchronized. BAPTA-AM, thapsigargin and U73122 hyperpolarized SMCs, relaxed the vessel, decreased basal calcium levels and abolished vasomotion. Chloride substitution abolished rhythmical activity, depolarized SMCs, increased basal calcium levels and constricted the vessel, while niflumic acid and DIDS abolished vasomotion. Ryanodine, charybdotoxin and TRAM-34, but not iberiotoxin, 4-aminopyridine or apamin, each depolarized SMCs and increased the frequency of rhythmical depolarizations and [Ca(2+)](i) oscillations. We conclude that vasomotion in the basilar artery depends on the release of intracellular calcium from IP(3) (inositol 1,4,5,-trisphosphate)-sensitive stores which activates calcium-dependent chloride channels to depolarize SMCs. Depolarization in turn activates voltage-dependent calcium channels, synchronizing contractions of adjacent cells through influx of extracellular calcium. Subsequent calcium-induced calcium release from ryanodine-sensitive stores activates an intermediate conductance potassium channel, hyperpolarizing the SMCs and providing a negative feedback pathway for regeneration of the contractile cycle.},

The differentiated state of the VSMC is characterized by specific contractile proteins, ion channels, and cell surface receptors that regulate the contractile process and are thus termed contractile cells. In addition to these normal functions, in response to injury or during development, VSMCs are responsible for the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, become migratory and proliferate. This phenotype has been termed synthetic cells. To better understand the mechanisms regulating these and other processes, scientists have depended on cultured cells that can be manipulated in vitro.

abstract = {The stability of cortical function depends critically on proper regulation. Under conditions of migraine and stroke a breakdown of transmembrane chemical gradients can spread through cortical tissue. A concomitant component of this emergent spatio-temporal pattern is a depolarization of cells detected as slow voltage variations. The propagation velocity of approximately 3 mm/min indicates a contribution of diffusion. We propose a mechanism for spreading depolarizations (SD) that rests upon a nonlocal or noninstantaneous feedback in a reaction-diffusion system. Depending upon the characteristic space and time scales of the feedback, the propagation of cortical SD can be suppressed by shifting the bifurcation line, which separates the parameter regime of pulse propagation from the regime where a local disturbance dies out. The optimization of this feedback is elaborated for different control schemes and ranges of control parameters.},

abstract = {Cytosolic Ca2+ waves occur in a number of cell types either spontaneously or after stimulation by hormones, neurotransmitters, or treatments promoting Ca2+ influx into the cells. These waves can be broadly classified into two types. Waves of type 1, observed in cardiac myocytes or Xenopus oocytes, correspond to the propagation of sharp bands of Ca2+ throughout the cell at a rate that is high enough to permit the simultaneous propagation of several fronts in a given cells. Waves of type 2, observed in hepatocytes, endothelial cells, or various kinds of eggs, correspond to the progressive elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ throughout the cell, followed by its quasi-homogeneous return down to basal levels. Here we analyze the propagation of these different types of intracellular Ca2+ waves in a model based on Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release (CICR). The model accounts for transient or sustained waves of type 1 or 2, depending on the size of the cell and on the values of the kinetic parameters that measure Ca2+ exchange between the cytosol, the extracellular medium, and intracellular stores. Two versions of the model based on CICR are considered. The first version involves two distinct Ca2+ pools sensitive to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and Ca2+, respectively, whereas the second version involves a single pool sensitive both to Ca2+ and IP3 behaving as co-agonists for Ca2+ release. Intracellular Ca2+ waves occur in the two versions of the model based on CICR, but fail to propagate in the one-pool model at subthreshold levels of IP3. For waves of type 1, we investigate the effect of the spatial distribution of Ca(2+)-sensitive Ca2+ stores within the cytosol, and show that the wave fails to propagate when the distance between the stores exceeds a critical value on the order of a few microns. We also determine how the period and velocity of the waves are affected by changes in parameters measuring stimulation, Ca2+ influx into the cell, or Ca2+ pumping into the stores. For waves of type 2, the numerical analysis indicates that the best qualitative agreement with experimental observations is obtained for phase waves. Finally, conditions are obtained for the occurrence of "echo" waves that are sometimes observed in the experiments.},

The solution is valid for finite strain of the cell membrane provided that the membrane is isotropic, elastic and incompressible. The most general nonlinear elastic stress-strain law for the membrane in a state of generalized plane stress is used. A necessary condition for a red cell to be able to sphere is that its extensional stiffness follow a specific distribution over the membrane. This distribution is strongly influenced by the surface tension in the cell membrane. A unique relation exists between the extensional stiffness, pressure differential, surface tension, and the ratio of the radius of the sphere to that of the undeformed red cell.

@article{Dormanns2015a,
abstract = {The human brain critically relies on a continuous blood supply to ensure its function. Impaired cerebral perfusion is associated with diseases, such as Alzheimer’s Disease, cortical spreading depression and stroke. Cerebral cells work together to ensure a finely regulated blood supply. However, many of the underlying mechanisms of this regulation, termed neurovascular coupling (NVC), are still not fully understood. The development of mathematical models of cell signalling is a promising approach that complements experimental studies by investigating the contribution of key components and pathways and guiding further experiments. This dissertation reports the development of a lumped parameter compartment model of a neurovascular unit (NVU), comprising neurons, astrocytes, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells. The model couples neuronal activity to vasodilation/contraction models via the an astrocytic mediated perivascular K+ and the a smooth muscle Ca2+ pathway. It successfully relates a neuronal input signal to the corresponding vessel reaction. It was found that the voltage-operated Ca2+ channels are, due to the hyperpolarisation from the K+ efflux of the SMC, almost entirely closed and do not seem to play a significant role during neuronal activity. The current model shows that in contrast to a number of experiments, outlining the importance of astrocytic Ca2+ in NVC, this Ca2+ pathway is not the only one mediating NVC. Model inputs from the endothelial side of the blood vessel in form of luminal agonists provide a flux of IP3 into the EC cytosol. EC/SMC coupling through gap junctions has a substantial effect on the NVC dynamics. The IP3 influx induces Ca2+ release from the SMC stores resulting in Ca2+induced Ca2+ release oscillations which were shown to inhibit NVC. The incorporation of nitric oxide (NO) signalling pathways in the NVU model shows the vasodilating effects of NO in the resting state. Furthermore, dilation during neuronal activation is enhanced with NO dynamics included. Results show that K+ release is responsible for the fast onset of vascular response, whereas NO-modulated mechanisms maintain dilation. The govern- ing source of NO that diffuses into the SMC, which provides the contractile force, depends on neuronal activation. In the resting state the EC provides the major contribution of NO release for vasorelaxation, whereas during neuronal stimulation NO produced by the NE dominates. In a scaled model, embedded in a parallel computing environment, multiple NVUs were connected to a space filling binary tree, facilitating the simulation of a perfusing vascular tree. The model couples the NVUs to the vasculature via stretch-mediated Ca2+ channels on both the EC and SMC . The coupling between the vasculature and the set of NVUs was found to be relatively weak for the case with agonist induced where only the Ca2+ in cells inside the activated area becomes oscillatory. However, the radii of vessels both inside and outside of activated areas oscillate (albeit small for those outside). In addition, simulations reveal a different oscillation profile when comparing coupled and decoupled states with the time required to refill the cytosol with decreasing Ca2+ and increasing frequency with coupling. The solution algorithm is shown to have excellent weak and strong scaling. Results have been generated for tissue slices containing up to 4096 NVUs, which corresponds to an area of 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm of cerebral tissue.},

abstract = {The regulation of epithelial Na(+) channel (ENaC) activity by Na(+) was studied in Xenopus oocytes using two-electrode voltage clamp and patch-clamp recording techniques. Here we show that amiloride-sensitive Na(+) current (I(Na)) is downregulated when ENaC-expressing cells are exposed to high extracellular [Na(+)]. The reduction in macroscopic Na(+) current is accompanied by an increase in the concentration of intracellular Na(+) ([Na(+)](i)) and is only slowly reversible. At the single-channel level, incubating oocytes in high-Na(+) solution reduces open probability (P(o)) approximately twofold compared to when [Na(+)] is kept low, by increasing mean channel closed times. However, increasing P(o) by introducing a mutation in the beta-subunit (S518C) which, in the presence of [2-(trimethylammonium) ethyl] methane thiosulfonate (MTSET), locks the channel in an open state, could not alone abolish the downregulation of macroscopic current measured with exposure to high external [Na(+)]. Inhibition of the insertion of new channels into the plasma membrane using Brefeldin A revealed that surface channel lifetime is also markedly reduced under these conditions. In channels harbouring a beta-subunit mutation, R564X, associated with Liddle's syndrome, open probability in both high- and low-Na(+) conditions is significantly higher than in wild-type channels. Increasing the P(o) of these channels with an activating mutation abrogated the difference in macroscopic current observed between groups of oocytes incubated in high- and low-Na(+) conditions. These findings demonstrate that reduction of ENaC P(o) is a physiological mechanism limiting Na(+) entry when [Na(+)](i) is high.},

abstract = {The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is the reg- ulated interface between the peripheral circulation and the central nervous system (CNS). Although originally observed by Paul Ehrlich in 1885, the nature of the BBB was debated well into the 20th century. The anatomical substrate of the BBB is the cerebral microvascular en- dothelium, which, together with astrocytes, pericytes, neurons, and the extracellular matrix, constitute a “neu- rovascular unit” that is essential for the health and func- tion of the CNS. Tight junctions (TJ) between endothe- lial cells of the BBB restrict paracellular diffusion of water-soluble substances from blood to brain. The TJ is an intricate complex of transmembrane (junctional ad- hesion molecule-1, occludin, and claudins) and cytoplas- mic (zonula occludens-1 and -2, cingulin, AF-6, and 7H6) proteins linked to the actin cytoskeleton.Theexpression and subcellular localization of TJ proteins are modu- lated by several intrinsic signaling pathways, including those involving calcium, phosphorylation, and G-pro- teins. Disruption ofBBBTJ by disease or drugs can lead to impaired BBB function and thus compromise the CNS. Therefore, understanding how BBB TJ might be affected by various factors holds significant promise for the prevention and treatment of neurological diseases.},

abstract = {Measurements of the dimensions and membrane rotational frequency of individual erythrocytes steadily tank-treading in a rheoscope are used to deduce the surface shear viscosity of the membrane. The method is based on an integral energy principle which says that the power supplied to the tank-treading cell by the suspending fluid is equal to the rate at which energy is dissipated by viscous action in the membrane and cytoplasm. The integrals involved are formulated with the aid of an idealized mathematical model of the tank-treading red blood cell (RBC) (Keller and Skalak, 1982, J. Fluid Mech., 120:24–27) and evaluated numerically. The outcome is a surface-averaged value of membrane viscosity which is representative of a finite interval of membrane shear rate. The numerical values computed show a clear shear-thinning characteristic as well as a significant augmentation of viscosity with cell age and tend toward agreement with those determined for the rapid phase of shape recovery in micropipettes (Chien, S., K.-L. P. Sung, R. Skalak, S. Usami, and A. Tozeren, 1978, Biophys. J., 24:463–487). The computations also indicate that the rate of energy dissipation in the membrane is always substantially greater than that in the cytoplasm. © 1984, The Biophysical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Many experimental studies have shown that arterial smooth muscle cells respond with cytosolic calcium rises to vasoconstrictor stimulation. A low vasoconstrictor concentration gives rise to asynchronous spikes in the calcium concentration in a few cells (asynchronous flashing). With a greater vasoconstrictor concentration, the number of smooth muscle cells responding in this way increases (recruitment) and calcium oscillations may appear. These oscillations may eventually synchronize and generate arterial contraction and vasomotion. We show that these phenomena of recruitment and synchronization naturally emerge from a model of a population of smooth muscle cells coupled through their gap junctions. The effects of electrical, calcium, and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate coupling are studied. A weak calcium coupling is crucial to obtain a synchronization of calcium oscillations and the minimal required calcium permeability is deduced. Moreover, we note that an electrical coupling can generate oscillations, but also has a desynchronizing effect. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate diffusion does not play an important role to achieve synchronization. Our model is validated by published in vitro experiments obtained on rat mesenteric arterial segments.},

abstract = {Astrocytes have traditionally been considered ancillary, satellite cells of the nervous system. However, work over the past decade has revealed that they interact with the vasculature to form a gliovascular network that might organize not only the structural architecture of the brain but also its communication pathways, activation, thresholds and plasticity. The net effect is that astroglia demarcate gray matter regions, both cortical and subcortical, into functional compartments whose internal activation thresholds and external outputs are regulated by single glial cells. The array of these astrocyte-delimited microdomains along the capillary microvasculature allows the formation of higher-order gliovascular units, which serve to match local neural activity and blood flow while regulating neuronal firing thresholds through coordinative glial signaling. By these means, astrocytes might establish the functional as well as the structural architecture of the adult brain.},

The deformed shape is governed by equilibrium of tensions exerted by the various interfaces and the solid film, a form of Neumann's triangle. Unlike Young's equation, which specifies the contact angles at the junction of two fluids and a (rigid) solid, and is fundamentally underdetermined, both tensions in the solid film can be determined here if the liquid-vapor surface tension is known independently. Tensions in the solid film have a contribution from elastic stretch and a constant residual component. The residual component, extracted by extrapolation to films of vanishing thickness and supported by analysis of the elastic deformation, is interpreted as the solid-fluid surface tension, demonstrating that compliant thin-film structures can be used to measure solid surface tensions.},

@article{Goldbeter1990,
abstract = {In a variety of cells, hormonal or neurotransmitter signals elicit a train of intracellular Ca2+ spikes. The analysis of a minimal model based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores shows how sustained oscillations of cytosolic Ca2+ may develop as a result of a rise in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) triggered by external stimulation. This rise elicits the release of a certain amount of Ca2+ from an InsP3-sensitive intracellular store. The subsequent rise in cytosolic Ca2+ in turn triggers the release of Ca2+ from a second store insensitive to InsP3. In contrast to the model proposed by Meyer and Stryer [Meyer, T. \& Stryer, L. (1988) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85, 5051-5055], the present model, which contains only two variables, predicts the occurrence of periodic Ca2+ spikes in the absence of InsP3 oscillations. Such results indicate that repetitive Ca2+ spikes evoked by external stimuli do not necessarily require the concomitant, periodic variation of InsP3. The model is closely related to that proposed by Kuba and Takeshita [Kuba, K. \& Takeshita, S. (1981) J. Theor. Biol. 93, 1009-1031] for Ca2+ oscillations in sympathetic neurones, based on Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ release. We extend their results by showing the minimal conditions in which the latter process gives rise to periodic behavior and take into account the role of the rise in InsP3 caused by external stimulation. The analysis further shows how signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations might be effectively encoded in terms of their frequency through the phosphorylation of a cellular substrate by a protein kinase activated by cytosolic Ca2+.},

Since then, the NVU has attracted the interest of the neuroscience community, resulting in considerable advances in the field. Here the current state of knowledge of the NVU will be assessed, focusing on one of its most vital roles: the coupling between neural activity and blood flow. The evidence supports a conceptual shift in the mechanisms of neurovascular coupling, from a unidimensional process involving neuronal-astrocytic signaling to local blood vessels to a multidimensional one in which mediators released from multiple cells engage distinct signaling pathways and effector systems across the entire cerebrovascular network in a highly orchestrated manner. The recently appreciated NVU dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, although still poorly understood, supports emerging concepts that maintaining neurovascular health promotes brain health.},

Over the past decade, a number of important studies have identified astrocytes as key intermediaries in neurovascular coupling (NVC), the mechanism by which active neurons signal blood vessels to change their diameter. Activity-dependent increases in astrocytic Ca2+ activity are thought to contribute to the release of vasoactive substances that facilitate arteriole vasodilation. A number of vasoactive signals have been identified and their role on vessel caliber assessed both in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we discuss mechanisms implicating astrocytes in NVC-mediated vascular responses, limitations encountered as a result of the challenges in maintaining all the constituents of the neurovascular unit intact and deliberate current controversial findings disputing a main role for astrocytes in NVC.

The BVP phase plane can be divided into regions corresponding to the physiological states of nerve fiber (resting, active, refractory, enhanced, depressed, etc.) to form a ???physiological state diagram,??? with the help of which many physiological phenomena can be summarized. A properly chosen projection from the 4-dimensional HH phase space onto a plane produces a similar diagram which shows the underlying relationship between the two models.

abstract = {Evaluation of plasma viscosity has been underutilized in the clinical practice. Plasma viscosity is determined by water-content and macromolecular components. Plasma is a highly concentrated protein solution, therefore weak protein–protein interactions can play a role that is not characterized by electrophoresis. The effect of a protein on plasma viscosity depends on its molecular weight and structure. The less spheroid shape, the higher molecular weight, the higher aggregating capacity, and the higher temperature or pH sensitivity a protein has, the higher plasma viscosity results. Plasma is a Newtonian fluid, its viscosity does not depend on flow characteristics, therefore it is simple to measure, especially in capillary viscosimeters. Its normal value is 1.10–1.30 mPa s at 37°C and independent of age and gender. The measurement has high stability and accuracy, thus little alterations may be pathologically important. Inflammations, tissue injuries resulting in plasma protein changes can increase its value with high sensitivity, though low specificity. It can increase in parallel with erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), but it is not influenced by hematocrit (anemia, polycytemia), or time to analysis. Based on these favorable features, in 1942 plasma viscosity was recommended to substitute ESR. In hyperviscosity syndromes plasma viscosity is better in follow-up than ESR. In rheumatoid arthritis, its sensitivity and specificity are better than that of ESR or C-reactive protein. Plasma fibrinogen concentration and plasma viscosity are elevated in unstable angina pectoris and stroke and their higher values are associated with higher rate of major adverse clinical events. Elevation of plasma viscosity correlates to the progression of coronary and peripheral artery diseases. In conclusion, plasma viscosity should be measured routinely in medical practice.},

The well-known Cauchy-Born rule is extended to account for a three-dimensional (3D) reference configuration. Using the strain energy density function and the deformation gradient tensor, the elastic properties of the RBC membrane were predicted by minimizing the potential energy in the representative cell. This extended formulation was then coupled with the meshfree method for numerical modeling of the finite deformation of the RBC membrane by simulating the optical tweezer experiment using a self-written MATLAB code. The results obtained provide new insight into the elastic properties and deformability of RBC membrane. In addition, the proposed method performs better when compared with those found in literature in terms of prediction accuracy and computation efficiency.},

@article{Sarrouilhe2014,
abstract = {Migraine is a common, recurrent, and disabling primary headache disorder with a genetic component which affects up to 20\% of the population. One third of all patients with migraine experiences aura, a focal neurological disturbance that manifests itself as visual, sensitive or motor symptoms preceding the headache. In the pathophysiology of migraine with aura, activation of the trigeminovascular system from the meningeal vessels mediates migraine pain via the brainstem and projections ascend to the thalamus and cortex. Cortical spreading depression (CSD) was proposed to trigger migraine aura and to activate perivascular trigeminal nerves in the cortex. Quinine, quinidine and the derivative mefloquine are able to inhibit CSD suggesting an involvement of neuronal connexin36 channels in CSD propagation. More recently, CSD was shown to induce headache by activating the trigeminovascular system through the opening of stressed neuronal Pannexin1 channels. A novel benzopyran compound, tonabersat, was selected for clinical trial on the basis of its inhibitory activity on CSD and neurogenic inflammation in animal models of migraine. Interestingly, in the time course of animal model trials, tonabersat was shown to inhibit trigeminal ganglion (TGG) neuronal-glial cell gap junctions, suggesting that this compound could prevent peripheral sensitization within the ganglion. Three clinical trials aimed at investigating the effectiveness of tonabersat as a preventive drug were negative, and conflicting results were obtained in other trials concerning its ability to relieve attacks. In contrast, in another clinical trial, tonabersat showed a preventive effect on attacks of migraine with aura but had no efficacy on non-aura attacks. Gap junction channels seem to be involved in several ways in the pathophysiology of migraine with aura and emerge as a new promising putative target in treatment of this disorder.},

@article{Koenigsberger2005,
abstract = {It is well-known that cyclic variations of the vascular diameter, a phenomenon called vasomotion, are induced by synchronous calcium oscillations of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, the role of the endothelium on vasomotion is unclear. Some experimental studies claim that the endothelium is necessary for synchronization and vasomotion, whereas others report rhythmic contractions in the absence of an intact endothelium. Moreover, endothelium-derived factors have been shown to abolish vasomotion by desynchronizing the calcium signals in SMCs. By modeling the calcium dynamics of a population of SMCs coupled to a population of endothelial cells, we analyze the effects of an SMC vasoconstrictor stimulation on endothelial cells and the feedback of endothelium-derived factors. Our results show that the endothelium essentially decreases the SMCs calcium level and may move the SMCs from a steady state to an oscillatory domain, and vice versa. In the oscillatory domain, a population of coupled SMCs exhibits synchronous calcium oscillations. Outside the oscillatory domain, the coupled SMCs present only irregular calcium flashings arising from noise modeling stochastic opening of channels. Our findings provide explanations for the published contradictory experimental observations.},

@article{Chuquet2007,
abstract = {Spreading depression (SD) is a propagating wave of neuronal depolarization and ionic shifts, seen in stroke and migraine. In vitro, SD is associated with astrocytic [Ca2+] waves, but it is unclear what role they play and whether they influence cerebral blood flow, which is altered in SD. Here we show that SD in vivo is associated with [Ca2+] waves in astrocytes and neurons and with constriction of intracortical arterioles severe enough to result in arrest of capillary perfusion. The vasoconstriction is correlated with fast astrocytic [Ca2+] waves and is inhibited when they are reduced. [Ca2+] waves appear in neurons before astrocytes, and inhibition of astrocytic [Ca2+] waves does not depress SD propagation. This suggests that astrocytes do not drive SD propagation but are responsible for the hemodynamic failure seen deep in the cortex. Similar waves occur in anoxic depolarizations (AD), supporting the notion that SD and AD are related processes.},

abstract = {Three different theoretical models were considered for the mechanism of the oscillation of the intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) linked to the K+ conductance of the plasma membrane (GK) observed in bullfrog sympathetic ganglion cells. The models assumed a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism, an active Ca2+ uptake mechanism at a Ca2+ reservoir site in the ganglion cell, and a Michaelis—Menten type relationship between [Ca2+]i and GK. Including both active and passive Ca2+ transport mechanisms at the plasma membrane, either a one-compartment model or a two-compartment model for the intracellular Ca2+ store reconstructed successfully the [Ca2+]i oscillation and rhythmic membrane hyperpolarizations observed in the ganglion cell, and simulated most of their characteristics. On the other hand, a two-compartment model disregarding of Ca2+ transport at the plasma membrane failed to reproduce the oscillations of [Ca2+]i and membrane potential. },

@article{DUPONT1993311,
abstract = {Abstract Experimental observations indicate that Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) may underlie Ca2+ oscillations in a variety of cells. In its original version, a theoretical model for signal-induced Ca2+ oscillations based on CICR assumed the existence of two types of pools, one sensitive to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and the other one sensitive to Ca2+. Recent experiments indicate that Ca2+ channels may sometimes be sensitive to both IP3 and Ca2+. Such a regulation may be viewed as Ca2+-sensitized IP3-induced Ca2+ release or, alternatively, as a form of IP3-sensitized CICR. We show that sustained oscillations can still occur in a one-pool model, provided that the same Ca2+ channels are sensitive to both Ca2+ and IP3 behaving as co-agonists. This model and the two-pool model based on CICR both account for a number of experimental observations but differ in some respects. Thus, while in the two-pool model the latency and period of Ca2+ oscillations are of the same order of magnitude and correlate in a roughly linear manner, latency in the one-pool model is always brief and remains much shorter than the period of oscillations. Moreover, the first Ca2+ spike is much larger than the following ones in the one-pool model. These distinctive properties might provide an explanation for the differences in Ca2+ oscillations observed in various cell types.},

The answers to these questions depend on the properties of cells, the fundamental units of life. Essentials of Cell Biology introduces readers to the core concepts of cell biology. This course can provide an introduction to cell biology for beginning students of all ages or be a springboard to more specialized topics for advanced students. The course begins with a discussion of the fundamental properties of cells: the origin of the cell, how cells are organized, how they reproduce, and how they use energy. Other units in the course expand these topics and provide insight into the processes that regulate cell function and generate the amazing variety of cell types seen in living organisms. Topics include the decoding process that produces distinct sets of proteins in different cell types, the cellular structures responsible for cell function, the signals that cells use to communicate with one another, and the intricate controls on cell division. At the end of each unit in this eBook there is the option to test your knowledge with twenty multiple-choice questions.},
