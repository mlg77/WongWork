\ac{hs} is a disorder that affects the physical shape of the \ac{rbc} in the human body causing them to become spherical in shape. Patients with \ac{hs} often experience anemia as a side affect from the increased rate of degeneration of \ac{rbc} with symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath, irritability, dizziness or lightheadedness, increased heart rate, headache and heart palpitations. The deformation of spherical \ac{rbc}s leads to the increased rate of degeneration and is, thus, highly important to understand. This research looks to modify surface stability mathematical relationships to suit the physiological make up of a \ac{rbc}. Three possible approximations were chosen to explore and suitable mathematical relationships defining the surface stability were generated. For each of the options had associated benefits and disadvantages with no option being able to be validated without extensive additional research.
